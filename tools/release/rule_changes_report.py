"""Writes a Markdown report of every rule change between consecutive seasons.

Reads the main rules files of docs/research/rules-0.6.0 (the files that are not
-clubs, check, check2, reconcile, databases or academy files). For each nation and
competition it lists the season where a field changes, with the old and new text.

A field value of unknown, n/a or empty is no information. It is skipped, and the
next known value is compared with the last known one, so a change is listed once
and an unknown season never shows as a change.

## What the game will not do

A row of the rules files states the real rule. The game limits some of them, so the report lists the real change and marks the limit. Three limits apply:

- The bench and the substitutes used stay at 9 or fewer (Q375). The match engine clamps at 9. A real rule of more than 9 shows in the report, and the game plays 9.
- The MLS stays at 12 clubs (Q404). The group code of the original holds 12. MLS expansion clubs get no place.
- Each league holds at most the clubs that its league code in the original holds, for example 20 clubs at most in the Argentine Primera División, 18 in Serie A and 16 in the J1 League. Some leagues also keep a smallest count, because a cup of their nation needs their clubs. A real count outside these limits shows in the report, marked "The game keeps N clubs (league sizes)". The real clubs that do not fit stay in the division below or in no division.
