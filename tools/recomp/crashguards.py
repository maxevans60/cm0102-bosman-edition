"""Crash guards (0.5.0 slice 1, #46): NULL tests at the known crash sites of the original.

The original stops at these sites when a pointer is NULL, because Windows does not map page 0. The port maps
page 0 (src/recomp_rt/host/posix.c, win32.c), so without a guard the game goes on with wrong data, and a NULL
write puts bytes at a low address that later NULL reads see. Each guard tests the pointer just before the
instruction that reads or writes through it. If the pointer is NULL, the guard goes to the exit that the
crash research lists (docs/research/2026-10-16-crash-fixes.md, section 1a). If the pointer
is not NULL, the instruction runs as before: a game that does not reach the fault takes the same path. A guard
does not change the flags.

Each entry names the address of one instruction, its text, the NULL test and the C code that runs when the test
is true. The translation checks the text and the build stops if it does not match (translate.py). A guard sits
at the first instruction where the registers are the same as at the jump of the patch, so the exit sees the same
state. tests/recomp/test_crashguards.py runs each guarded function with a NULL pointer and with a good pointer.

Left out: the guard at 0x5f74ac (its caller is not read yet) and every patch that changes a rule.
