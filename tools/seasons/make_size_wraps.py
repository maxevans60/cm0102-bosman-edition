"""Makes src/recomp_rt/win/season_size_wraps.c: one RT_WRAP for each set_up_rules of the league classes of
tools/recomp/league_sizes.py (0.6.0 slice 18).

Usage:
    python3 -I tools/seasons/make_size_wraps.py [--out src/recomp_rt/win/season_size_wraps.c] [--check]

set_up_rules (vtable +0x8c) writes the promotion and relegation places of a league (+0xbe promotion, +0xbf
promotion play-off, +0xc0 relegation play-off, +0xc1 relegation; League::has_automatic_promotion 0x684790,
League::has_relegation 0x6847b0). The constructor and start_new_season call it. Each wrap calls the original
and then season_sizes_rules(this), which sets the places of the season in a season game
(src/recomp_rt/win/season_sizes.c).

The file is committed, because the recompiler reads the RT_WRAP lines of src/recomp_rt/win/*.c. --check
writes nothing and exits with code 1 when the committed file differs from what the tool makes (ctest
season_size_wraps). RT_WRAP stops the build when an address is not a translated function.
