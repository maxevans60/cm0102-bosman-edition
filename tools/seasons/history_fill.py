"""Matches the researched history rows with each season database before 2010/11 (0.6.0 slice 11c, Q347).

Usage:
    python3 -I tools/seasons/history_fill.py <3.9.68 Data folder> <folder of database folders> [--rules <folder>]
        [--write]

Reads the research table docs/research/history-0.6.0/<part>.tsv (the research brief, kept outside the repo, gives the columns) and, for
each database, decides which researched rows the game adds at a new game in the database's season:

- the row is `held = yes`, its label year is 2002 or later, and the database has the competition;
- the edition ended before the start (ended before July of the start year), or it is a calendar-year edition
  whose label is the start year and whose last match is in September or later (the 3.9.68 data holds the 2001
  season of the calendar-year leagues in the same way; see the slice doc). A row with a game_season (Q277: an
  edition that the game plays in another season than in real life) ends at the end of that season (ended_of).

Each kept row is compared with the rows that the database holds for that competition and label year after the
year shift of slice 11b (tools/seasons/history_gaps.py): `add` (the database has no row), `agree` (the same first
and second clubs), `differ` (another result). The clubs and national sides are matched by their full name in the
database, then by their short name, within the nation of the competition first.

Gap rows (row CONCACAF place 1, the maintainer, 27 October 2026): a database of 2010/11 or later holds its own history,
which the game keeps. Where it holds no row at all of a competition in GAP_COMPETITIONS, the kept researched rows
of that competition are added (`add`, nothing cleared). The US Open Cup: Con_Champ::pick_clubs 0x4c11a0 gives
CONCACAF place 1 to its newest winner (0x4afd80), and September 2010 ODB, December 2010 SIM, April 2011 SIM and
March 2012 SIM hold no US Open Cup row. Where such a database holds a row of a GAP_COMPETITIONS competition whose
winner is a club of another nation than the competition's, the row is cleared and the researched row of its label
added (`clear`, `add` with result `differ`): eleven databases, April 2021 to May 2026, name club 977, Atlanta of
Argentina, as the 2019 US Open Cup winner in place of Atlanta United FC, and the CONCACAF Champions Cup of 2020 to
2022 starts took it (0.6.2 open item 49). Only clubs of the club table are tested (a national side has no nation
field there). Note: a --write run on a database folder that lacks some databases of the first run leaves their
rows out of plan.tsv; the rows of item 49 were added from this function's output on test-fixtures/databases.

Official data sets (0.6.2 open item 149): 3.9.60, 3.9.65 and 3.9.68 keep the history of 2001 in every start year,
so the same rules give their plan for every start year from 2002 (3.9.68: 2003, after its 2002/03 tile) to the
year after the last researched edition ended. plan-official.tsv gives each row once, with the first and the last
start year for which it holds (last_start empty: every later one). 3.9.60 and 3.9.65 come from the folder of
databases (official versions, by signature).

--write writes docs/research/history-0.6.0/fill-report.tsv (counts per database) and unmatched.tsv (names that do
not match in a database), plan.tsv, plan-official.tsv and no-winner.tsv. The files hold competition and club names
only.
