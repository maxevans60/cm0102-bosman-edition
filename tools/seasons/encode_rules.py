"""Encodes the nation rules of the rules table for the game (0.6.0 slice 17).

Usage:
    python3 -I tools/seasons/encode_rules.py --write     write the three outputs below
    python3 -I tools/seasons/encode_rules.py --check     read the parts, stop on a text the tool does not know,
                                                         and check that the committed outputs are up to date

Input: the "nation rules" rows of the 20 parts of docs/research/rules-0.6.0/ (one row per nation and season, 28
nations, 2001/02 to 2027/28), read with make_rules.read_rows(). The text columns are foreign, work_permit,
registration and windows.

Outputs (committed):
    docs/research/2026-10-17-nation-rules-encoded.tsv   one line per nation and season: the structured value of
                                                        each column
    docs/research/2026-10-17-nation-rules-gaps.tsv      one line per text the tool could not encode, with the
                                                        reason (for Max)
    src/recomp_rt/win/season_nation_table.c             the C table of the runtime (season_nation_rules)

The structured values (the same words in the TSV and in the C table):
    windows        keep      no new information: the game keeps the windows it has (the last encoded ones)
                   none      no transfer windows: the club can sign at any time
                   D.M-D.M[,D.M-D.M...]
                             the windows of the season, day.month of the start and the end (1.7-31.8,1.1-31.1).
                             A start month after the end month runs over the new year.
    squad_non_eu, squad_foreign, sign_non_eu, sign_foreign
                   keep      no new information
                   none      no limit
                   N         the limit. squad_*: players of that kind in the match squad of a first division
                             fixture (the number of an existing slot of the restriction record, +5 non-EU, +2
                             foreign). sign_*: players of that kind a club may hold when it signs another
                             (the rules object's caps +0x14 and +0x13 of TRANSFER_RULES).
    permit         keep, or brexit (players of the EU/EEA need a permit as non-EU players: UK nations, from 1
                   January 2021, or from the start of the season when the season starts after that date)

What the tool does not encode is listed in the gaps file, each with a reason (the reasons are the keys of
GAP_REASONS): the game has no code for it ("needs new code"), the text has no single value for the season,
or the tool does not know the form of the text. A text of "unknown" or "n/a" is not a gap: it keeps the game's
values (status keep). The tool stops, with exit code 1, on a text that it neither knows as an encoding nor as a
reason, so a changed research text never goes unseen.
