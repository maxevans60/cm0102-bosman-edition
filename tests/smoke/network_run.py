"""Two-game run (0.7.0 slice 2, #45): a host game and a joining game on this computer play one network game.

Usage:
    python3 tests/smoke/network_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--address a.b.c.d] [--shots <folder>]
        [--joiners n] [--slow k]

The games use the same timed clicks as the smoke run (RECOMP_SCRIPT), each with its own empty user folder.

The host: Network Play, Start Network Game, the game name "Bosman", Select League(s) Next (the original makes
the network game here, setup_create_or_join_network_game 0x8388e0, and loads the database), then its own Enter
Name screen (0x820f50). The run starts the joiners when the host's screen log reaches that screen.

Each joiner: Network Play, Join Network Game, the game list (0x81f8d0), types the host's address in the Join
field and clicks Next. Max's decision Q32: the games meet through this computer's LAN address (--address,
default: the address of the default route), not 127.0.0.1, because the original's loopback test 0x8af290 holds
127.0.0.1:6667. The host opens Enter Name on the joiner's channel (setup_on_network_player_joined 0x838a80)
and sends it. The joiner types "Join" and "Two" and clicks Next, and the host sends Select Nationality
(setup_handle_enter_name_input 0x821520). After the joiners quit, the host's own manager types the same names on
its own Enter Name and clicks Next, as the joiner did.

The click repeat (research note, section 11): while the button is down, the client loop 0x7fdc00 sends a click
(opcode 6) for each new host screen (Display::poll_input 0x55f620 at 0x7fdf17). Without the runtime's fix, the
press of the join click reached the host's Enter Name as Next ("Names Are Blank"), and Next on Enter Name also
clicked Next on Select Nationality (Select Team). Checks 2, 5 and 6 catch it.

Checks:
    1 each game ends with code 0
    2 the joiner's Enter Name equals the host's own Enter Name (at most 1% of pixels differ: the text cursor),
      so the join gave no "Names Are Blank"
    3 the joiner's Enter Name after its typed names went to the host and back equals the host's own with the
      same names
    4 the traffic logs (RECOMP_NET_LOG) show the connection on both sides, with packets both ways
    5 after Next on Enter Name the joiner's screen equals the host's own Select Nationality (not Select Team)
    6 each joiner sends 4 click packets (opcode 6): no press is sent twice and none is lost, the press that
      ends a text entry on Next included

--slow k multiplies every step time and timeout by k, for the Windows build under wine in an emulated container.

--joiners n (default 1, at most 3) starts n joiners at once, for the traffic of n + 1 human managers. The run
prints each game's traffic log. With --shots the dumps and logs stay in that folder.

--lobby (0.7.0 slice 4) runs the lobby with the host and four joiners. The lobby is a local copy of the server
(server/, `npx wrangler dev`, so server/node_modules must exist: `cd server && npm ci`), or --lobby-url. Two fake
lobbies in this script stand in for the failures. The host has RECOMP_LOBBY_URL set and Online play on.
    join1  Online play on: the game list shows the host once (one row for each host, not one for each adapter,
           and not again as a lobby row). It clicks that row and joins through the LAN, as above.
    join2  Online play on, lobby rows only (RECOMP_TEST_NO_LAN_ROWS), another version (RECOMP_TEST_VERSION): the
           list shows the host's lobby row with the season, the day and the managers online. Join gives the box
           with the host's version.
    join3  Online play off, lobby address of a fake lobby that counts connections: it types the host's address
           and joins as above. The fake lobby must see no connection.
    join4  Online play on, a fake lobby that answers full_today: the list shows the "full today" row, and Join on
           it gives the box that says so.
--relay (0.7.0 slice 5) runs the host and n joiners (--joiners) through the relay of the lobby (the local copy, or
--lobby-url for the deployed server). Each joiner sees only lobby rows (RECOMP_TEST_NO_LAN_ROWS), clicks the
host's row and joins through the relay; the game sees an ordinary socket. Checks 1 to 6 hold as on the LAN (the
joiner's connection is to the row's 0.66 address, and the host's connections are from 0.66.255.<channel>), with
checks 7 and 10 and:
   11  each joiner joined through the relay and the host held one relay connection; the relay lines of the
       host's log give the frames that it sent (batches of about 50 ms)

--game-name <word> names the host's game (default Bosman). --remote n (with --relay and --lobby-url) runs the host only and waits --remote-wait seconds (default 1800) at
its Enter Name for n joiners on other computers, for example the GitHub machines of
.github/workflows/online-join.yml (tests/smoke/relay_join_remote.py). The checks are 1, 4 (the host's side, n
connections), 7, 10 and 11 (the host's side). The host's dumps stay in --shots, for relay_join_remote.py
--compare with the joiners' dumps.
Lobby checks, besides checks 1 to 6 for join1 and join3:
    7  the lobby lists the game with the name, the version, the database, a season, a day, the managers online
       and no password, while the host plays
    8  join1's list has one row for the host's game; join2's list has its lobby row with the details
    9  join2 and join4 see the reason of the refused join; join3's lobby saw no connection
   10  the lobby lists no game after the host quit
