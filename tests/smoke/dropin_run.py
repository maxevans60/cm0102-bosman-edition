"""Drop in, drop out and host quit (0.7.0 slice 6, #45): a two-game run with a drop, a rejoin and a host quit.

Usage:
    python3 tests/smoke/dropin_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--shots <folder>] [--slow k] [--kick]
        [--lobby-url URL]

It uses the timed clicks of tests/smoke/network_run.py and a local copy of the lobby (server/, `npx wrangler dev`),
or --lobby-url.

The host makes the network game "Bosman" and its own manager with Arsenal, and waits on Manager Status. Then:
    join1  joins, types the names "Join Two" and the manager password "pw", takes the second club of Select Team,
           reaches Manager Status and quits: a drop. The host's runtime sees the closed connection, and the
           original's leave path (0x838c00) puts the club on holiday: Away.
    join2  joins again with the same names. The host opens Manager Status for it (0x838a80), it clicks the row of
           its old manager, types "pw" in the password box (0x822ec0) and takes the club back. It clicks Finish.
Then the host clicks Finish, the game starts, and the host quits (the script's quit, as a window close). The host's
game saves at its screen loop (net_session.c), and join2 sees "The host left the game" and goes back.

--kick (in place of the rejoin): join1 clicks Finish, the game starts, and the host opens the Network tab of the
Options box. It clicks Kick for join1, then No (join1 stays), then Kick and Yes: join1's club goes on holiday and
join1 sees "The host removed you from the game" (0.7.0 slice 7). The Network tab shows join1's ping.
--leave (in place of the rejoin): join1 clicks Exit Game and Yes. The host sends it the quit packet (result -12,
0x7fcd79), its club goes on holiday, and join1 shows no "The host left the game".

Checks:
    1 each game ends with code 0
    2 the host's lobby entry lists join1's club as Away after the drop (or the kick), and no club as Away after the
      rejoin
    3 the host's log shows join1's club on holiday after the drop and back in play after join2's password
    4 the host saved at its quit: the log line and a save file in the host's save folder
    5 join2 shows "The host left the game" and then the start screen (0x81bab0)
    6 kick: No keeps join1, Yes kicks it (host log), join1's game shows "The host removed you from the game", and the Network
      tab showed join1's ping
    7 leave: join1 shows no "The host left the game"
