"""A joiner's tactics drag in a network game, in both display modes (0.7.0 item 212).

Usage:
    python3 tests/smoke/network_drag_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> --out <folder> [--slow k]

Four LAN games, Online play off, one for each display of the host and the joiner (classic, widescreen). In each, the
host makes the network game and takes Arsenal (tests/smoke/dropin_run.py), the joiner joins, takes the second club
(Barnsley, 4-4-2) and both click Finish. After the first news the joiner opens its squad's Tactics, drags the left MC
(575, 340 on 800x600) up to (575, 270), and opens Tactics again from the squad screen. The drop reaches the host in
the joiner's click: the Display's drag rectangle and the pitch widget (net_scale.c). The host's tactics input then
places the player.

Checks, for each joiner display:
    1 every game ends with code 0
    2 the player moved to the drop: the pitch changed both around the start (575, 340) and around the drop (575, 270),
      each in the joiner's own pixels (the boxes of SPOT)
    3 the pitch after the drag, and on the Tactics opened again (the host's data), is the same under a classic host and
      under a widescreen host
Before the fix a widescreen joiner's drag on a classic host left the player at MC, and any drag on a widescreen host
made him FL. Each run keeps its dumps and logs in <folder>/<host>-<joiner>.
