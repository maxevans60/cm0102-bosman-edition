"""New-game check on every Update Team database (0.4.0 slice 12).

Usage:
    python3 tests/smoke/update_team_sweep.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> <folder of databases> [--jobs n]
        [--timeout s] [--out table.md] [--seasons <Seasons folder> --seasons-tool <seasons_db_test>]
        [--select-all [--start <year>]]

<folder of databases> holds one folder per database (Max keeps them in test-fixtures/databases). Each run
copies one whole folder into Databases of a new user folder, sets database = folder:<name> and plays the
steps of smoke_run.py up to the first news screen and holiday. A run passes when the date box moves on
after "Go on Holiday". A run that fails or hangs names the last step it reached. At most --jobs (6) games
run at the same time. The table is a Markdown table (folder, result, seconds, failure step).

With --seasons the databases are those of a download (0.6.0 slice 14): <Seasons folder> holds the season
database zips (tools/release/make_season_zips.py). The run unpacks each one with the first pick of the game
(seasons_db_prepare_in, through the test program seasons_db_test that ctest builds) into a new save folder, and
sweeps those folders. <folder of databases> is then not used: give any existing folder.

With --select-all (0.6.0) each run clicks Select All on Select League(s) and starts the game in the season of
its database (RECOMP_START_SEASON, the year from docs/research/2026-10-16-season-database-table.md). Only the 21
season databases of that table run. A message box of the game ends the run and names its text in the failure
step. In a season that is not 2001 the box "fra_first..cpp 108" is an expected stop and counts as a pass
(EXPECTED_STOP); "Database.cpp 1844" and any other box fail. The table gives the reserve rows of blank staff
that the new game used (staff_reserve.c). --start <year> starts every game in that year instead.
