"""Attribute groups in every language (0.6.1 item 8): a goalkeeper gets the Goalkeeping group in each language.

Usage:
    python3 tests/smoke/groups_language_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--dir <fixtures folder>]
        [--only base,season] [--languages 1,4] [--keep <folder>] [--jobs 2]

The groups once found a goalkeeper by the positions text (0x53ee50) starting with "GK". That text is in the
chosen language, so in Italian no player was a goalkeeper: a keeper got the Technical group and no Handling or
Reflexes. The runtime now reads his position ratings (groups_is_keeper, src/recomp_rt/win/groups_layout.c).

Each run sets the language of game.cfg (the int at offset 8, 1 to 10 as database_language_file_exists
0x535930 counts them), turns attribute_groups on, opens the profile of the first player of the squad list (a
goalkeeper) and of a later one (an outfield player), and logs the value labels of both profiles
(RECOMP_COLOUR_LOG=1, columns.c). The check, in every language:
    - the first column of the goalkeeper holds 7 values (the Goalkeeping group) and that of the outfield
      player 10 (the Technical group);
    - base only: the numbers of each profile, in the order of its labels, are the same as in English. The
      values are numbers in every language, so this holds only when each attribute has the cell it has in
      English. The English run must show 26 numbers for the goalkeeper and 29 or more for the outfield player.
The season games pick the default club of the language's nation, so their players differ between languages.
