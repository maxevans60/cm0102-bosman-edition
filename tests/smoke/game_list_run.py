"""Game list run (0.7.0 slice 4a, Q31, Q33): the game list of a joining game holds 50 games, and a join of the
last game reaches the right host.

Usage (as root, in a Linux container with network namespaces, see tests/smoke/game_list_wine.sh):
    python3 tests/smoke/game_list_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--shots <folder>] [--slow k]

The original keeps a game for each sender address of a "CM3 LIST SERVER ACK" (Network::receive_packet 0x77af20,
the address from format_ipv4_address at 0x77b10d, a second ACK from the same address dropped at 0x77b145..0x77b1b1).
So 50 games need 50 sender addresses. The run makes a network namespace "fake" with a link to the joiner's
namespace: the joiner has 10.50.0.1/24, the fake host has 10.50.0.101 to 10.50.0.150, one for each game. A Mac
cannot do this without root, so the run uses the Windows build under wine, as network_wine.sh does.

The fake host (this file with --fake-host) answers the joiner's "CM3 LIST SERVER REQ" with one ACK from each
address, in a fixed shuffled order, in the 119-byte layout (research note, section 2): the tag of 19 bytes, the
host name in bytes 19..68 and the game name "Game NN" in bytes 69..118. Game NN comes from 10.50.0.(100 + NN).
When the joiner's dump of the picked row exists, it sends a "CM3 LIST SERVER BYE" from five of the addresses.
It takes the joiner's TCP connection on port 6667 and writes the address that the joiner connected to.

The joiner: Network Play, Join Network Game, the game list (0x81f8d0). The list shows 6 rows a page with the
area's scrollbar (Area::layout 0x403350). Each click on the scrollbar's down arrow moves the list one row.

Checks:
    1 the joiner ends with code 0
    2 with 50 games, the list moves on each of the first 44 clicks of the down arrow, and not on the 45th:
      the list has 50 rows
    3 after the 5 BYEs (45 games), the list moves on each of the first 39 clicks, and not on the 40th
    4 the joiner picks the last row (Game 50) and clicks Next: the fake host gets the TCP connection on
      10.50.0.150, the address of Game 50
