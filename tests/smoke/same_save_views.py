"""Same-save checks of the 0.4.0 screens: a feature must not change the game (spec 2026-10-15-features-0.4.0).

Usage:
    python3 tests/smoke/same_save_views.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--check compare|print|tactics|match-tactics]
        [--days n] [--dir <fixtures folder>]

Each check plays the same game from start.sav (tests/fixtures) in runs at the same time, goes on holiday
for n game days (default 2) and compares the saved games byte for byte (smoke_run.compare_runs).

    compare   The original's "Compare two chosen players" screen (Seaman and Shaaban, set with the prompts of
              the profile's Action drop-down) with squad_views on and off, in classic and in widescreen mode.
              The squad_views screen must make the same calls that change the game (the training manager's
              call, the random numbers). Its widgets sit in other memory blocks, so the five parts of the
              save that depend on the memory layout (LAYOUT_PARTS, Q152) may differ; no other part may.
    print     The squad printed from the squad screen's Print drop-down as a PDF (the default) and as a File
              (Print To in Game Settings), with the same clicks otherwise. The PDF message box must not
              change the game (Q152): the texts of the box are in runtime memory, not on the game's heap.
    tactics   The tactics screen in its Condition view (Squad, Assistant > Pick best team, Tactics, Ok) with
              match_columns on and off, in classic and in widescreen mode (#48, 0.5.0). The option adds a
              positions label to each row and gives the list new column weights. Both move the game's
              memory blocks (research of slice 3: each alone changes the five parts), so the five parts of
              LAYOUT_PARTS may differ (Q152) between on and off; "on again" must equal "on".
    match-tactics The same in a match (prematch.sav, the Basel friendly of the match check), with a
              substitution at half time, in classic and widescreen (--mode m1,m2 to choose). Not HD: there
              an injury before half time opens the tactics screen, and these steps do not handle it. The game
              is saved after the match (5 days). --shots <folder> keeps the screen of each run.
