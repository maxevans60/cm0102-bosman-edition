"""Two joiners click Finish at the same moment (0.7.0, slice 9's quit leg of 2026-10-29: the host stayed on Manager
Status after its Finish, with one joiner shown "Playing").

Usage:
    python3 tests/smoke/finish_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--shots <folder>] [--slow k] [--runs n]
        [--delta ms]

--delta ms: join2's Finish comes this much after join1's (in step time, scaled by --slow).

The host makes the network game "Bosman" and its manager with Arsenal, and waits on Manager Status. join1 and join2
join, make their managers at the second and third club of Select Team, and click Finish on Manager Status at the same
moment: join2 starts 40 s after join1 (so the host makes the managers one after the other) and clicks 40 s earlier
by its own clock. Then the host clicks Finish. Each
Finish marks its channel done (the input 0x820950 returns -5 at 0x820d06, and the screen loop sets the done flag at
0x7fd25a..0x7fd27b); the screen loop ScreenManager::monitor 0x7fc7e0 ends when every channel is done (0x7fd525..
0x7fd555), and the game starts.

Checks, for each run:
    1 the host reaches its first news (both joiners' Finish took effect) and ends with code 0
