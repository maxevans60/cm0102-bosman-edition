"""Faults of the original that long games reach (0.6.2 slice 11): national managers (fault 26, Q23) and money above
2,147,483,647 (faults 27 and 28, Q24) and the human manager's age (fault 33, Q27).

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/original_faults_run.py managers <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> --save <in.sav> --keep <folder>
        [--days 400] [--keep-faults]
    python3 tests/seasons/original_faults_run.py money <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> --keep <folder>
        [--balance 2500000000,5000000000,12000000000] [--days 45] [--keep-faults]
    python3 tests/seasons/original_faults_run.py age <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> --keep <folder> [--born 1870]
        [--keep-faults]

managers: loads a save made on holiday (a soak leg of tests/seasons/soak_run.py, changing rules on, the 3.9.68
database), plays --days game days on holiday and saves (soak_run.load_leg). It reads the senior national teams of
both saves (nat_club.dat: the first nation-count rows; the manager at club +0xcf, the players of the nation at nation
+0x88) and checks:
    - at the end, every senior national team has a manager, but for at most 2 (a vacancy waits for its start date;
      the default of 400 days ends in mid August, after the contract ends of 30 June and the month check of 1 August)
    - a national manager left in the run and his team got a new manager (a retirement or a move to a club)
    - no message box, and the program ends with code 0
--keep-faults runs with RECOMP_ORIGINAL_FAULTS=keep (the original's rule). The checks must then fail: this is the
proof that they find the fault (the same holds for money). The suggested save: the 2011 leg of the 0.6.0 soak seed 6
(run-logs/release-test-0.6.0/long-games/soak-seed6/leg09/user/samesave.sav), where 161 of 213 teams have no manager.

money: for each balance, sets the balance of Arsenal (the human's club) and of Liverpool (an AI club whose budget follows its balance: club +0x82 is 0, see
docs/research/2026-10-30-money-64bit.md) in start.sav of the
test fixtures (tools/save/edit_money.py), loads it, opens Arsenal's Finances view (a screen dump), goes on holiday and
saves --days game days later (tests/fixtures/fixtures.py play). The runtime logs each 64-bit amount that a screen
formats (RECOMP_MONEY_LOG: "money text") and each transfer budget of a club above 2,147,483,647 ("money budget").
The checks, for each balance:
    - the Finances view formats the full balance and the full transfer funds ("money text" lines; the funds are at
      least 99% of the balance)
    - Liverpool's budget is at least 99% of its balance, as below 2,147,483,647 (the fault gave a tenth: the floor
      of `get_transfer_budget` was cut to 32 bits), and its shortlist (`try_add_player_to_club_shortlist`, return
      0x84301b, 32 bits) sees that budget clamped to 2,147,483,647
    - `TRANSFER_OFFER::build_bid` asks for Liverpool's budget and gets a positive one (return 0x8e6335 or 0x8e74a7).
      It asks only while it builds a bid. This check also passes with the fault kept (the budget is then a tenth):
      the budget check above is the one that finds the fault
    - no message box, and the program ends with code 0

age: sets the birth year of the human manager of start.sav (+0x12) to --born, loads it, goes on holiday and saves 3
game days later. The day loop stores each staff member's age at +0x18 (0x5cd3c4); for an age above 127 the save must
hold 127, where the original's byte wraps to a negative age.
