"""UEFA 2021/22 to 2023/24 check (0.6.0 slice 24): the Europa League of 32 clubs with knockout round play-offs,
no away goals rule, and no UEFA places for a suspended nation (Russia from 2022/23).

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/uefa_2021_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--only <name>,...] [--jobs n]
        [--keep <folder>]

Each run is a season jump of tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py with England. The runs:
    2021    October 2021, changing rules off, the season 2021/22
    2022    October 2022, changing rules off, the season 2022/23: Russia is suspended
    2023    October 2023, the season 2023/24: Russia is suspended, the Super Cup goes to penalties after 90
            minutes
    change  November 2020, changing rules on, 2020/21 to the end of 2021/22: the news sentences of the change
The checks of each run: the jump ends with code 0 and shows no message box of the game; the log of
src/recomp_rt/win/season_uefa*.c shows the access list places, 8 Europa League groups of 4 drawn, the knockout
round play-offs drawn, and the no away goals rule in the two-legged rounds of the Champions League and the
Europa League (qualifying rounds and knockout stages, 4 round tables); the uefa line of the report at the end of
each season of the rules: Champions League 9 stages, 32 clubs in groups, a knockout of 16 in 4 rounds; Europa
League 9 stages, 32 clubs in 8 groups, a knockout stage of 24 clubs (16 in the play-offs and the 8 group winners)
in 5 rounds, each with a winner; the label of round code 30 of the Europa League is the real name of 2021/22.
2022 and 2023: the log line of the seeding counts 0 clubs of Russia with a UEFA place. No Champions League or
Europa League tie of a season from 2021/22 is decided on away goals (the log line of the wrap of 0x51f2f0), and
in the change run at least one of 2020/21 is.
Part 24b, the Conference League (a new competition record and a second object of the Uefa_Cup class): the object
is made for the first season of the rules, it has entrants and qualifying rounds, takes the losers of the
Champions League and the Europa League, draws 8 groups of 4 with 32 clubs and its knockout round play-offs with the
8 Europa League thirds, and its uefa line at the end of each season is as the Europa League's (9 stages, 32 in
groups, 24 in the knockout, 5 rounds, a winner). Its round code 30 has the label of the Europa League's. No
Conference League tie of the season is decided on away goals either. The change run gives the news sentence of
its first season.
    load    October 2021: the game saves 30 days after the start (inside the qualifying rounds) and 120 days after
            the start (in the group stage); a new program loads each save and plays to the end of the season;
            the three cups play to a winner
    repeat  October 2021, twice: the saves 120 days after the start (in the group stages, with the Conference League)
            are equal (a moved season repeats)
A run takes about 10 to 40 minutes on a loaded machine. --jobs (default 1).
