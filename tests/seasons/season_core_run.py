"""Season core check (0.6.0 slice 11): a game that starts in another season, and the season part of a save.

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/season_core_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--database <folder>] [--year y]
        [--days n] [--only base|season|rename] [--keep <folder>] [--jobs n]

The checks, played at the same time:
    base-off    a new base game (2001/02, 3.9.68, changing_rules = off) saved after n days (default 14): its save
                has no season part, as a save of 0.5.0.
    base-on     the same with changing_rules = on: the save has the part with 2001 and changing rules on.
    season      a new game in the year (default 2010) with the database folder (default the September 2010 ODB
                of test-fixtures/databases): the first news screen is in July of the year, the fixture store
                holds no calendar year before it (RECOMP_SEASON_LOG), the game goes on holiday for n days without
                a crash and the save has the part with the year and changing rules on.
    season-again  the same steps again: the save is byte for byte the same (the same clicks, the same game).
    season-italy  the season game with Italy selected too (the Italian leagues hold fixed 2001/02 fixture lists):
                the first news screen is in July of the year and the fixture store holds no year before it.
    season-off  the season game with changing_rules = off: the part holds the year and changing rules off.
    reload      loads the save of "season" in a new user folder with no RECOMP_START_SEASON, plays 3 days and
                saves: the runtime reads the year from the part, and the new save has the part with the year.
    reload-off  the same with the save of season-off: the new save keeps changing rules off.
    later       the save of "season" with a part of a later version (version 3, 36 bytes): it loads with the
                fields that this version knows, and the new save has a version 1 part.
    damaged     the save of "season" with a damaged part (year 1999): the load is refused with a message box.
Names and club moves (slice 15): the runs read the season tables of the build (RECOMP_RULES_TABLE, build
folder seasons/), when the build has them. Then also:
    base-off    no competition gets a name and no club moves (the base game);
    season      the log shows the club moves and the names of the start season; the save holds the season
                names (club_comp.dat) and its season part the database names, which the load matches by name
                (0x60efd0, season_change_rename of slice 16);
    reload      the load gives the names again.
    rename      a new base game (2001/02, changing_rules = off) with the test variable
                RECOMP_SEASON_CHANGE_TEST=rename (the record "UEFA Cup" becomes "Test Cup" at the new game, as a
                name of slice 15 would): its save has the season part, version 2, with the name in the data.
    rename-reload  loads that save, plays 3 days and saves: the load finds its key competitions (no box
                "index.cpp 5809"), and the new save keeps the name in the data.
--keep <folder> keeps the save of "season" there (for a check with another build).
--jobs n plays at most n games at the same time (default 6).
Each run uses -seed 1, the test clock and a new user folder. The steps are those of tests/smoke/smoke_run.py
(Arsenal, or the first club of the list) in classic mode.
