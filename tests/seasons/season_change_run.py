"""Season change check (0.6.0 slice 16, Q232, Q258): the July step and its news item.

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/season_change_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--only <name>,...] [--jobs n]
        [--keep <folder>]

Each run is a season jump of tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py over one season change (start in X, last
season X+1), with changing_rules on and the test log RECOMP_SEASON_CHANGE_LOG=1. The names are those of the
names table of slice 15 (Seasons/names.tsv, tools/seasons/make_names.py). The runs (the era boundaries of the
build brief):
    2002    3.9.68 data from 2002/03, across 2002/03 to 2003/04
    2008    September 2008, across 2008/09 to 2009/10 (the UEFA Cup becomes the Europa League)
    2020    November 2020, across 2020/21 to 2021/22
    2023    October 2023, across 2023/24 to 2024/25
    off     September 2008 with changing_rules off: no change and no news
    load    September 2008: the game saves 352 days after the start (mid July 2009, after the change of 20 June),
            then a new program loads that save, returns from holiday, goes through the unread items of the
            Competitions filter with Next Unread (the runtime logs the text that the season item's write_text
            gives the screen, and the item's date), plays on with Space (each news item, then Continue Game)
            and saves again 10 days after the load (RECOMP_SAVE_AFTER_DAYS). The save of a game with a
            changed name must load: the game finds its key competitions by name (0x60efd0), and without the names in the
            data the load stops at the box "index.cpp 5809". Both saves must hold the news text and the
            changed name in their season part (bosman_season.dat, version 2)
    december September 2010 ODB with Japan and Norway, across 2010/11 to 2011/12, with the test kind
            RECOMP_SEASON_CHANGE_TEST=1 (a sentence for each competition that starts from 1 October). The
            calendar-year leagues change on 27 November and 27 December 2010 for season 2011: their sentences
            must wait, the season hook of 2011 and the news item of 2011/12 come on the season point in June
            2011, and no item is sent in 2010

The checks (each run):
    - the jump ends with code 0 and the report holds the end of X and of X+1 (a stopped run fails)
    - on: the competitions whose names table name of X+1 (the row of the object's number) differs from their
      name at the end of X have the new name at the end of X+1 in the rules report (1 June: the international entries change as late as 15 and
      28 August, after the start report of 1 August), and every other competition keeps its name
    - on: the news log lists exactly one sentence "<old name> is now called <new name>." for each of them,
      for season X+1, and the news item of X+1 is sent once (no news item when no name changes)
    - off: the report names at the end of X+1 are the names at the end of X, and the log has no change after
      the start season (the hooks of the start season run with any changing rules, "(start season)" in the log)
A run takes about 6 to 8 minutes. --jobs (default 3) runs that many at the same time. --reuse checks the
reports already in the --keep folder again without a new run.
