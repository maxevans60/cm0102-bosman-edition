/* The youth pool rule (0.6.2 slice 20, open item 52; src/recomp_rt/win/youth_pool.c).
 *
 * 1. The cases of the rule: the shares of the 2001 data are not short, the nations of the 2041 forum save are.
 * 2. A model of a world: one loaded nation of 2000 players and 40 nations of 23 to 62 players that are not
 *    loaded, 300 years from 2001, five seeds. Each day a player of 31 or more retires with a chance of 1 in 400,
 *    and each retirement gives one new player, with the ages of regenerate_as_youth_player 0x7abac0: 15 to 20
 *    for the loaded nation; 23 to 27 when rand(start players) < rand(1000), else 17 to 23, for the others. With
 *    the rule of the original alone, small nations run out of players under 21 or under 23. With the fix (young
 *    ages for a short nation, and the new player of a nation that is not short going to a nation that runs out)
 *    no nation of 23 players or more has none under 21 or none under 23 at any check, one each decade. A small
 *    nation grows until its own retirements keep its youth pool: at most 35 players in 300 years. */
