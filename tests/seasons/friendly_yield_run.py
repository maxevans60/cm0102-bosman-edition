"""A qualifier outranks a friendly (0.6.2 item 208, season_friendly_dates.c, cancel_friendlies).

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/friendly_yield_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> --save <save> --database <folder>
        --keep <folder>
    python3 tests/seasons/friendly_yield_run.py --log <stderr.txt>      (check the log of an earlier run only)

The case: run set game a2021s1 (October 2021 database, 2021 start, changing rules on), the save of leg000
(samesave.sav, made in 2031), loaded Tier A and played from 2031 day 202 to 2033 day 188. The snap places the
game's friendlies on the FIFA days first, so before the fix a friendly held the FIFA day of a qualifier made later:
the 18 pairs of the CAF round with template day 170 of 2032 were planned for the FIFA day 156 (4 June) and went to
day 153, which is not a FIFA day, as each side had a game friendly on 156 (run-logs/0.6.2-s203/probe-lines.txt).
The original ranks a friendly below a competition match: add_fixture 0x5aa680 cancels a clashing friendly with
Friendly::cancel 0x5c6570 (at 0x5aa9d0). After the fix the snap does not count a friendly and cancels the
friendlies of the two nations within 2 days of the qualifier's day with 0x5c6570.

The checks, from the game's log (RECOMP_SCREEN_LOG names each move and each cancelled friendly):
- the run ends with code 0 and no message box;
- every CAF qualifier of template day 170 of 2032 moves to the FIFA day 156 of 2032 (at least one);
- at least one friendly is cancelled for a qualifier, each within 2 days of the qualifier's day;
- no qualifier moves from its planned day because of a friendly (the move line names what holds the day).
Red on lead/merge-062ag b4966397 (the CAF pairs go to day 153, no friendly cancelled), green on the fix.
