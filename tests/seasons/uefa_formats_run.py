"""UEFA formats check (0.6.0 slice 22): the Champions League, UEFA Cup and Intertoto Cup of each season play the
format of the rules table, after a season change and after a load.

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/uefa_formats_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--only <name>,...] [--jobs n]
        [--keep <folder>]

Each run is a season jump of tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py. The rules report holds a "uefa" line for the
Champions League and the UEFA Cup at the start and end of each season (src/recomp_rt/win/season_uefa.c): the
stage count, the current stage, the clubs of the group stages in stages 0 to 7 and after them, and the clubs and
rounds of the knockout stage, and the winner of its history row of the season; a "schedule" line gives the
dates that the Schedule tab lists (Comp::build_match_date_list 0x48d500): none may have a year outside the
season, and the Champions League with a round of 16 lists no group match day after its group stage. The runs:
    2007    November 2007, changing rules off, the season 2007/08: Champions League with one group stage and a
            round of 16 (9 stages, 32 clubs in groups, 16 in the knockout), UEFA Cup with 40 clubs in groups and
            a knockout of 32 (9 stages), Intertoto Cup of 3 rounds (the log line of season_uefa_cup.c)
    change  3.9.68 data from 2002/03, changing rules on, to the end of 2004/05: 2002/03 is the original's
            format (13 stages, a second group stage of 16, quarter-finals, a UEFA Cup with no stages);
            2003/04 has the round of 16; 2004/05 the UEFA Cup groups. The news log
            (RECOMP_SEASON_CHANGE_LOG=1) has the sentence of each change in its season, and the report has no
            difference with the rules table that tests/seasons/rules_report_expected/changing-2002-england.tsv
            does not list (it lists no format line: each season plays the format of its row). The label of a
            round (the game's label function 0x4bfa30, long and abbreviated names) has its real name from the
            season of the rename (Q370): the Champions League "Round of 16" from 2003/04 (not in 2002/03),
            the UEFA Cup "Round of 32" and "First Qualifying Round" from 2004/05 ("Third Round" in 2003/04), and in
            the abbreviated names "Rnd of 16", "Rnd of 32" and the original's "Qual.1"
    off2002 3.9.68 data from 2002/03, changing rules off, to the end of 2003/04: both seasons keep the format and
            the round names of 2002/03 (Q232): 13 stages and "Second Round", not "Round of 16"
    load    November 2007: the game saves 240 days after the start (March 2008, the knockout stages of both
            cups), a new program loads the save, the holiday goes on to 1 June 2008, and the end report of
            2007/08 shows both knockout stages played to the end of the season (16 and 32 clubs)
The checks: each jump ends with code 0 and shows no message box of the game, the uefa lines are as above, and
each end line names a winner.
A run takes about 3 to 10 minutes. --jobs (default 2) runs that many at the same time.
