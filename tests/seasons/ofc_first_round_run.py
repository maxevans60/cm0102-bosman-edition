"""The preliminary round of OFC World Cup qualifying (0.6.2 item 198, season_ofc_first.c).

Usage:
    python3 tests/seasons/ofc_first_round_run.py <cm0102_recomp> <game folder> [--keep <folder>] [--cycles 1|2]

Real life: every OFC member enters World Cup qualifying, and the lowest-ranked play a first round before the main
stage (2014, 2018 and 2026 cycles: 4 teams at one host; docs/research/rules-0.6.0/int-world.tsv, rows
wc_oceania_league). Papua New Guinea played the qualifying of 2006 and of every cycle from 2014 to 2026. The
original's pool builder 0x91fa80 takes 10 nations and leaves out Papua New Guinea (key nation 0x9cf41c, 0x91fc93),
so it never plays. With changing rules on every Oceania nation enters: the best 10 take the group places, and the
weakest W = nations - 10 play two-leg ties against the W weakest of the 10 on FIFA days in the autumn before the
group draw (January of the campaign year); each winner takes its seed's place.

One new game, Tier A, England's leagues, seed 1, changing rules on, the 3.9.68 database, a 2001/02 start:
- leg 1 to MIDDLE (8 September 2003, between the two legs of the 2006 cycle's round), a save;
- leg 2 loads it and saves one day later: the Oceania section's part of the save is the same (save and load in
  the middle of the round give the same game), apart from the heap address words of group A's rows (masked);
- leg 3 loads the save of leg 1 and plays to 30 April 2005 (the groups under way), a save;
- with --cycles 2, leg 4 loads that and plays to 30 April 2009 (the 2010 cycle, Australia in Asia).

The checks: every leg ends with code 0 and no message box; in each cycle Papua New Guinea plays two matches of the
Oceania section between 1 July of the year before the campaign year and 16 January of the campaign year, each pair
of teams of that time meets twice, and every Oceania nation plays a match of the section in the cycle (to 30 April
of the year after the campaign year). On main before item 198 Papua New Guinea plays no match: the test fails there.
