"""History checker for the future runs (step 2 of lead-notes future testing): a saved game in, one TSV of the
history rows of every competition out, then the checks of those rows.

Usage:
    python3 -I tests/seasons/future/history_check.py <save.sav> [<save.sav> ...] [--out <folder>]
        [--rules <competitions.tsv>] [--known <known.tsv>] [--label <name>] [--nations <nations.tsv>]
        [--access <access.tsv>] [--table <season_intl_table.c>] [--health] [--tier-a]

--tier-a: the save is of a Tier A game (RECOMP_TIER_A=1; a save does not record it): the checks of real results
(same-final) are skipped, as run_set.py skips them for a Tier A row.

--out writes <label>.history.tsv, <label>.faults.tsv, <label>.entrants.tsv and with --health <label>.health.tsv.

The rows are the ones that the winners tab of each competition shows (0x4991f0 draws winner, runner-up, third
and host): the club comp history and the nation comp history of the save (club_comp_history.dat and
nation_comp_history.dat, 26 bytes a row: +0x00 id, +0x04 competition id, +0x08 u16 label year, +0x0a first,
+0x0e second, +0x12 third, +0x16 host, -1 for none; docs/research/2026-10-17-competition-history-fill.md). A row
with a negative competition is a free row. Club and national side ids index club.dat and then nat_club.dat
(581 bytes a record, +0x53 nation). A nation (nation.dat, 290 bytes) has its continent at +0x71. A competition
(club_comp.dat and nation_comp.dat, 107 bytes, the record id is the competition id) has its continent at +0x59
and its nation at +0x5d.

The save date is the latest date of the news list (news.dat: 100 items of 223 bytes after an 8-byte head, the
s16 day of the year from 0 and the s16 year at +0xc9 of each item). Inference: it matches the test logs of the gate runs (date 182/2028 in the
log, last news 189/2028 at the save after it). The start year and changing rules are the words +8 and +0xc of
bosman_season.dat (docs/research/2026-10-17-season-save-part.md, section 4); a save without that part is a 2001
game with changing rules off.

The edition year of a finals class: its .tmp part holds the word after the bytes ff ff ff ff 07 03 xx xx, seven
zero bytes, one byte and three zero bytes (inference from the parts of a 2028 save: FIFA World Cup 2030, the
classes after their table 2200, the ended cups 2999). An edition in progress writes a longer part, where the
pattern is absent; then the check reads nothing.

Checks (one row of <label>.faults.tsv each, check names in the first column):
    duplicate     a competition holds the same label year twice (three times for a split season: two rows a year in
                  most of the 10 years before the start, or an Argentine or Mexican competition with two rows in any
                  year before it: the game plays two titles a year there; the formats of SEVERAL_TITLES)
    no-host       a row with no host in a competition whose rows have hosts (more than half of its rows)
    confederation a winner or runner-up from another confederation, in a row from the start year on. The
                  confederation is the rules file's, else the competition's continent, else the continent of
                  80% or more of the winners before the start year (at least 3); none: no check
    same-final    the same two finalists more than 2 editions in a row (nation competitions, and club
                  competitions with no nation; with --rules every competition whose kind is not a league)
    gap           a gap in the cycle from the start year on: two editions further apart than the cycle and one
                  year. The cycle is the rules file's, else the most common step of the last 6 editions before
                  the start year
    (a competition whose rules cycle is 0 has ended: it gets none of the three checks below)
    missing       no edition after the last one up to the save date (the last edition + cycle + 1 < the save
                  year), for a competition with rows from the start year on or an international one; not for a
                  competition whose class waits on 2999 (ended) or whose rules end year has passed
    next-edition  the class waits for the year 2199 or 2200 (the idle year of rt_intl_next_year), or for a
                  year more than one cycle and one year after the save date. Not when 2199 or 2200 is within
                  one cycle and one year of the save date: a save in 2199 of a four-year cup is then due in 2200
Checks of the competition record (with --rules):
    comp-continent the record's continent is not a confederation of its rules (open item 21)
    comp-name     the short name (+0x38, 26 bytes, the name of the history screen) is another competition than the
                  long name; the rows are then also checked against the confederation of the short name, under
                  that name (open item 4: the UEFA Nations League record named "Asian Cup Quals")
    A winner whose nation moves confederation after the row's year (nations.tsv: Australia, OFC to 2005) passes.

Nations (--nations, default nations.tsv next to this file), for the changes due at the save date:
    nation-name   a live record (with a continent) under the old name of a rename
    side-name     a national side named with the old name while its nation holds the new one
    nation-confed a nation in another confederation than a move gives

Entrants: the fixtures parts give the teams of each edition (an edition: fixtures with no gap of more than 150
days, or after a final: a day of one match and then 25 days or more with none; its year the year of the last
match). The list gives each team's route in: title holder (the winner of
the edition before), host, the winner of a route competition, a winner or place 2 or 3 in the history of the
edition's year or the year before, else "qualifier". Checks, for the editions whose last match is before the
save date and that no longer run (the last edition of a competition with a match fewer than 14 days before the save
date and more than one match on its last day may go on: the July qualifying of a Champions League, open item 70).
A confederation check for every edition:
    entrant-confed entrants from another confederation than the rules give (also the short name's); in the World
                  Cup qualifying up to 2 teams of each other confederation pass (the play-off between
                  confederations); a nation with a due move to a confederation of the competition passes, and so
                  does the winner of a route competition (a Mexican winner of the Copa Sudamericana in the Recopa),
                  and a club now in the confederation that its nation moved to after the edition's first day
                  (nations.tsv; an edition that began before the move, as the Asian Club Championship of 2001/02
                  with Kazakh clubs, its row year 2002). A club still in the confederation it leaves is checked
    entrant-count  a finals edition with another count of teams than the finals table of the season code
                  (season_intl_table.c; after its last row the count of the last row), or than access.tsv
    entrant-host   a host of the finals table that the data holds is not an entrant; after the table, the host of
                  the edition's history row
    entrant-dead   entrants of a nation under the old name of a due rename, in an edition after the rename's
                  season (the dead record beside the live one,
                  or a record the rename missed); a nation with no continent in the data (Bonaire, Guadeloupe)
                  is no fault
    entrant-missing a live UEFA nation with a national side is not an entrant of a European World Cup qualifying
                  edition of at least 30 teams that began in the game: every member enters, less the European
                  hosts of its World Cup, less Russia from 2026 and less a nation that joins UEFA later (open item
                  57). Only where the season code builds the whole pool (uefa_all): not the 2002 campaign, not a
                  2001 game with changing rules off, from 2026 only with changing rules on or a 2025 start.
                  The hosts: the finals table (access.tsv), the save's host table (HostCountry.tmp), and after
                  the table (open item 76) a pair at most of UEFA nations that played the finals without the
                  qualifying, one of them the history row's host (finals_hosts; the pool leaves the hosts out:
                  season_wcq26.c europe_nations, the original 0x919ee3)
    duty-clash    a continental club match within one day of a match of a national side that holds 3 or more
                  players of one of the clubs (they are on duty, 0x7757d0; open item 93). For an Olympic match of the
                  under-21 sides the fault is only a club that keeps fewer than 11 players it can field: not on duty,
                  at the club, not injured (open item 107), with the virtual players of its free squad slots for a
                  club with a nation (open item 164). The squad count of a senior or 'B' side applies only to its
                  matches up to 14 days after the save, the squads already picked (open items 157 to 162). The
                  Olympic count has no such limit. Fixtures still to be played; not in a 2001 game with changing
                  rules off
    entrant-holder the title holder is not an entrant (access.tsv "holder": the Champions League from 2006, the
                  Libertadores), when the edition before is at most one cycle and one year before; not for an
                  edition of the start year or before (it began before the game, the holder may be out)
    entrant-limit  a nation has more Champions League entrants than the association limit of the season (open item
                  70; season_uefa_cl_cap: 4 to 2014/15, 5 from 2015/16, 7 from 2024/25), in an edition of the
                  season code's access list (from 2009/10) that began after the start year, of 500 days or less;
                  not in a base game (changing rules off), which plays the original's format
    entrant-route  an entrant of a fixed-route competition (access.tsv: UEFA Super Cup, Recopa, Suruga Bank,
                  Intercontinental Cup, Finalissima, FIFA Intercontinental Cup) won none of its route competitions
                  in the year of the match or the edition before, when that edition is at most one cycle and one
                  year before (checked when every route competition has history rows, for an edition after the
                  start year: an edition of the start year may come from the data); a route competition with no
                  row written in the game (a year after the start) in the year or one cycle before did not play
                  (its nations are not selected), and its place goes to a drawn club, as the original draws one
                  (WorldClubChamp::pick_entrant 0x92ae60, World_Club_Cup 0x92baa8): each such route lets one
                  entrant of its confederation come by no route (slice 9a), of its nation for a national
                  competition (the J.League Cup place of the Suruga Bank, open item 77)
    save-part      a fixtures part whose size does not fit its count (not read)

World health (--health), Tier B: <label>.health.tsv holds the save size and part count, the players, under-21 and
under-23 players (age from the birth date at the save date), the squads of the senior and under-21 sides, the
clubs and national sides with a manager, and the club balances (lowest, highest, outside 32 bits), then one row
per live nation. Time per game day is not in a save. Checks:
    empty-squad   a senior side with no player in its squad while 23 players or more hold the nationality, or an
                  under-21 side with none while 11 or more of them are under 21 (Q17). Only a side with a match in
                  the 14 days after the save or one played in the 14 days before it: the pick runs 14 days ahead
                  of a fixture, so a side with no fixture has no squad (open item 195)
    no-youth      a nation with 23 players or more and none under 21 or none under 23 (Q31: the under-21 and
                  Olympic squads then empty). A fault that fails a Tier B run (Q35, open item 52)
    overflow      an age field that is not the age from the birth date (more than 1 year apart), or a balance
                  of 2^62 or more
    full-squad    a club with all 50 squad slots (club +0xd7) filled and fewer than 8 players aged 21 or under
                  outside its 14 best by current ability: the top-up 0x90dae0 has no slot for a virtual player,
                  the reserve pick 0x6dbc50 first keeps 14 first-team players out, and the rule "3 over 21"
                  (0x8cf7e0 type 3, the age field +0x18 against the limit at 0x8cf9a8) leaves fewer than 11
                  (open item 78). It reports, it does not fail a run

--rules (default: competitions.tsv next to this file, when it is there; lines with # are notes): per key (column comp) the columns
kind, confed (FIFA or nation: no check, else codes joined by |), has_host (0: no host check, 1: every row from
the start on needs one), cycle (0: the competition ended) and end_year (a year or none). --names (default
history_names.tsv next to this file) gives the key of each competition name of a save; a name with no key keeps
the rules above. --known: a TSV with check, competition (* for any text), year
(or *) and a note, and two optional columns: rules ("on" or "off": the row matches only a game with that
changing-rules setting) and accepted ("design" or "real": the note cites a source that shows the game matches the
original or real life; the fault is printed as "accepted", not a fault). A fault that matches another row is printed
as "known". Exit code 1 when a fault is not known or accepted.

    """[(check, competition, year, detail)]: duty-clash, a continental club match within one day of a match of a
    national side that holds DUTY_MIN or more players of one of the two clubs in its squad (open item 93 of 0.6.2).
    The player is then on duty for his side (NationalTeams::get_international_duty_club 0x7757d0 searches the
    side's fixtures from the day before to the day after, 0x775842..0x7758a8), and a club with many of them fields
    fewer than 11 (box match_eng.cpp 612 or 652). A continental club match: a competition with no nation and two
    clubs, not a friendly.
    The Olympics (open item 107) play the under-21 sides (the last rows of nat_club.dat: club id at least the count
    [0xae235c] minus [0xae2350], 0x540a2a..0x540a40), which carry the nation's name. Their squad is the
    under-21 pick (NationalTeams::select_squad 0x76c120, slot 2 with flag 4: 0x76c26d calls 0x53b4f0, 0x76c279;
    players aged 23 or under, 0x76cee3), so the players' +0x24 is the under-21 side. The Olympics are fixture type 1
    (0x669ae0), so 0x7757d0 holds them, as the original does. The real tournament overlaps the UEFA qualifiers too
    (2024: 24 July to 9 August, second qualifying round 23/24 and 30/31 July), and clubs need not release players
    for it (it is not on the FIFA international match calendar). So an Olympic match (olympics(), by its key) is a
    fault only when a club with a player in an Olympic side that plays within a day keeps fewer than SIDE_MIN
    players it can field, as VIRTUAL_STAFF::count_available_players 0x90d8f0 counts them: in its squad slots, not on
    duty for any side that plays within a day (0x7757d0), at the club (staff +0x39, the test after it) and with no
    injury (the fitness record's injury +0xe is -1, 0x62c49c; a player who recovers, status 1 of 0x62c400, counts
    as injured here, so the count errs toward a fault), plus the virtual players of the top-up (open item 164).
    VIRTUAL_STAFF::fill_fixture_squads 0x90d2f0 tops up both clubs of each fixture before the match
    (VIRTUAL_STAFF::top_up 0x90dae0 at 0x90d3bd and 0x90d3f4). The top-up counts the available players by position
    with 0x90d8f0 (a player on duty is not available, 0x90d9c3), and for a club with a nation (+0x53, 0x90db33) that
    is not an MLS All-Stars side (0x9d00a8, 0x9d00a4; they play no continental match) it adds virtual players to
    each of the 8 positions below its target, at most TOP_UP_MOST in all (0x90ddbc, 0x90dde0). The club targets are
    fixed, 4, 4, 4, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8 (row 0 set by the constructor 0x90d140 at 0x90d255..0x90d2b5, 44 players), so a
    club that keeps fewer than 11 is short by more than TOP_UP_MOST. Each virtual player (0x90e0a0) goes into the
    first empty squad slot (0x90e714..0x90e729), so the club gets one per free slot, at most TOP_UP_MOST. The cap
    only changes the number in the text: a club with TOP_UP_MOST free slots always reaches SIDE_MIN. Wasquehal (Tier
    A game a2006s1, UEFA Super Cup on 9 August 2016) kept 10 of 15 with 5 in the French Olympic side, had 25 virtual
    players at its team pick (0x6db500 at 0x6b8866) and picked 18. Not modelled: a club with a human manager whose
    count of +0x5e players is 20 or more can count an add that places no player (0x90df68, when 0x600a50 skips
    0x90dd92); it then also needs 10 or more players injured or banned. Not counted: bans (0x55d270, the ruling
    bodies' tables of discipline.dat, not read) and the European squad list
    (EUROPE_RULES::get_ineligibility_code 0x5832e0: staff +0x6d 2 for a player aged 20 or more in the original's
    four cups, except some rounds; a July save holds almost
    no registration yet). So the count can be above the match's: item 93's club keeps 12 registered players at the
    October 2029 save and fielded 9 on 22 November. Squads: club.dat +0xd7, SLOTS staff ids (-1 for none); the
    national side of a player's squad staff.dat +0x24 (the squads of the save date). Only fixtures still to be
    played, and none in the start season of a 2001 game, which keeps the original's dates (season_friendly_dates.c
    keeps_original). The squads of the save are those of the matches up to PICK_AHEAD days after it:
    NationalTeams::daily_update 0x76b100 picks the squads of the day two weeks ahead (0x54c770 with 2 at 0x76b126; in a
    replay of a2001offs2, the pick of day 213 of 2041 is for Japan's match of day 227), and the original's call-up move
    0x7777e0 acts on them that day. A later match is not judged: its squad is not picked yet, and the pick leaves out
    the regulars of a club with a match within a day (NationalTeams::select_squad 0x76c120, 0x76cd44..0x76cd73). In
    run set pass 3 (a2001offs1) Argentina's under-21 side held 3 San Lorenzo players in the July 2041 save for its
    match of 3 September; its own pick held 2, and the senior side's for 4 September none. A club match on its
    nation's match day is no fault in itself: clubs play on international match days, and a clash is a fault only
    when a picked player is due in two places. The Olympic count above has no PICK_AHEAD limit: Olympic squads are not
    read from these picks. One fault per competition and year, with its first case."""
