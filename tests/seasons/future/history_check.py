"""History checker for the future runs (step 2 of lead-notes future testing): a saved game in, one TSV of the
history rows of every competition out, then the checks of those rows.

Usage:
    python3 -I tests/seasons/future/history_check.py <save.sav> [<save.sav> ...] [--out <folder>]
        [--rules <competitions.tsv>] [--known <known.tsv>] [--label <name>] [--nations <nations.tsv>]
        [--access <access.tsv>] [--table <season_intl_table.c>] [--health]

--out writes <label>.history.tsv, <label>.faults.tsv, <label>.entrants.tsv and with --health <label>.health.tsv.

The rows are the ones that the winners tab of each competition shows (0x4991f0 draws winner, runner-up, third
and host): the club comp history and the nation comp history of the save (club_comp_history.dat and
nation_comp_history.dat, 26 bytes a row: +0x00 id, +0x04 competition id, +0x08 u16 label year, +0x0a first,
+0x0e second, +0x12 third, +0x16 host, -1 for none; docs/research/2026-10-17-competition-history-fill.md). A row
with a negative competition is a free row. Club and national side ids index club.dat and then nat_club.dat
(581 bytes a record, +0x53 nation). A nation (nation.dat, 290 bytes) has its continent at +0x71. A competition
(club_comp.dat and nation_comp.dat, 107 bytes, the record id is the competition id) has its continent at +0x59
and its nation at +0x5d.

The save date is the latest date of the news list (news.dat: 100 items of 223 bytes after an 8-byte head, the
s16 day of the year from 0 and the s16 year at +0xc9 of each item). Inference: it matches the test logs of the gate runs (date 182/2028 in the
log, last news 189/2028 at the save after it). The start year and changing rules are the words +8 and +0xc of
bosman_season.dat (docs/research/2026-10-17-season-save-part.md, section 4); a save without that part is a 2001
game with changing rules off.

The edition year of a finals class: its .tmp part holds the word after the bytes ff ff ff ff 07 03 xx xx, seven
zero bytes, one byte and three zero bytes (inference from the parts of a 2028 save: FIFA World Cup 2030, the
classes after their table 2200, the ended cups 2999). An edition in progress writes a longer part, where the
pattern is absent; then the check reads nothing.

Checks (one row of <label>.faults.tsv each, check names in the first column):
    duplicate     a competition holds the same label year twice
    no-host       a row with no host in a competition whose rows have hosts (more than half of its rows)
    confederation a winner or runner-up from another confederation, in a row from the start year on. The
                  confederation is the rules file's, else the competition's continent, else the continent of
                  80% or more of the winners before the start year (at least 3); none: no check
    same-final    the same two finalists more than 2 editions in a row (nation competitions, and club
                  competitions with no nation; with --rules every competition whose kind is not a league)
    gap           a gap in the cycle from the start year on: two editions further apart than the cycle and one
                  year. The cycle is the rules file's, else the most common step of the last 6 editions before
                  the start year
    (a competition whose rules cycle is 0 has ended: it gets none of the three checks below)
    missing       no edition after the last one up to the save date (the last edition + cycle + 1 < the save
                  year), for a competition with rows from the start year on or an international one; not for a
                  competition whose class waits on 2999 (ended) or whose rules end year has passed
    next-edition  the class waits for the year 2199 or 2200 (the idle year of rt_intl_next_year), or for a
                  year more than one cycle and one year after the save date
Checks of the competition record (with --rules):
    comp-continent the record's continent is not a confederation of its rules (open item 21)
    comp-name     the short name (+0x38, 26 bytes, the name of the history screen) is another competition than the
                  long name; the rows are then also checked against the confederation of the short name, under
                  that name (open item 4: the UEFA Nations League record named "Asian Cup Quals")
    A winner whose nation moves confederation after the row's year (nations.tsv: Australia, OFC to 2005) passes.

Nations (--nations, default nations.tsv next to this file), for the changes due at the save date:
    nation-name   a live record (with a continent) under the old name of a rename
    side-name     a national side named with the old name while its nation holds the new one
    nation-confed a nation in another confederation than a move gives

Entrants: the fixtures parts give the teams of each edition (an edition: fixtures with no gap of more than 150
days, or after a final: a day of one match and then 25 days or more with none; its year the year of the last
match). The list gives each team's route in: title holder (the winner of
the edition before), host, the winner of a route competition, a winner or place 2 or 3 in the history of the
edition's year or the year before, else "qualifier". Checks, for the editions whose last match is before the
save date (a confederation check for every edition):
    entrant-confed entrants from another confederation than the rules give (also the short name's); in the World
                  Cup qualifying up to 2 teams of each other confederation pass (the play-off between
                  confederations); a nation with a due move to a confederation of the competition passes, and so
                  does the winner of a route competition (a Mexican winner of the Copa Sudamericana in the Recopa)
    entrant-count  a finals edition with another count of teams than the finals table of the season code
                  (season_intl_table.c; after its last row the count of the last row), or than access.tsv
    entrant-host   a host of the finals table that the data holds is not an entrant; after the table, the host of
                  the edition's history row
    entrant-dead   entrants of a nation under the old name of a due rename, in an edition after the rename's
                  season (the dead record beside the live one,
                  or a record the rename missed); a nation with no continent in the data (Bonaire, Guadeloupe)
                  is no fault
    entrant-holder the title holder is not an entrant (access.tsv "holder": the Champions League from 2006, the
                  Libertadores), when the edition before is at most one cycle and one year before; not for an
                  edition of the start year or before (it began before the game, the holder may be out)
    entrant-route  an entrant of a fixed-route competition (access.tsv: UEFA Super Cup, Recopa, Suruga Bank,
                  Intercontinental Cup, Finalissima, FIFA Intercontinental Cup) won none of its route competitions
                  in the year of the match or the edition before, when that edition is at most one cycle and one
                  year before (checked when every route competition has history rows, for an edition after the
                  start year: an edition of the start year may come from the data)
    save-part      a fixtures part whose size does not fit its count (not read)

World health (--health), Tier B: <label>.health.tsv holds the save size and part count, the players, under-21 and
under-23 players (age from the birth date at the save date), the squads of the senior and under-21 sides, the
clubs and national sides with a manager, and the club balances (lowest, highest, outside 32 bits), then one row
per live nation. Time per game day is not in a save. Checks:
    empty-squad   a senior side with no player in its squad while 23 players or more hold the nationality, or an
                  under-21 side with none while 11 or more of them are under 21 (Q17)
    no-youth      a nation with 23 players or more and none under 21 or none under 23 (Q31: the under-21 and
                  Olympic squads then empty). A fault that fails a Tier B run (Q35, open item 52)
    overflow      an age field that is not the age from the birth date (more than 1 year apart), or a balance
                  of 2^62 or more

--rules (default: competitions.tsv next to this file, when it is there; lines with # are notes): per key (column comp) the columns
kind, confed (FIFA or nation: no check, else codes joined by |), has_host (0: no host check, 1: every row from
the start on needs one), cycle (0: the competition ended) and end_year (a year or none). --names (default
history_names.tsv next to this file) gives the key of each competition name of a save; a name with no key keeps
the rules above. --known: a TSV with check, competition (* for any text), year
(or *) and a note; a fault that matches is printed as "known". Exit code 1 when a fault is not known.
