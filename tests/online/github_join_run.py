"""Release test 3 of the online play spec (Q29, slice 9), the Mac's side: GitHub's Windows and Linux machines join a
game that this Mac hosts over the internet, with scripted clicks.

Usage:
    python3 tests/online/github_join_run.py <cm0102_recomp> [--game <folder>] [--server real|<address>]
        [--push --appimage <0.7.0 AppImage> [--win-build build-win]] [--run-id <id>] [--name <game name>]
        [--host-wait-minutes 45]
        [--out <folder>]

The workflow is .github/workflows/online-release-join.yml, and its joiner is tests/online/remote_join.py.
`gh workflow run` works only for a workflow on the default branch of GitHub, so the workflow must be pushed
first. A push waits for Max.

The steps:
    1  Wait for room (online_common.wait_for_room). The host makes a game named "00S9-<time>" (or --name): one
       word, because the type step reads one word, and 00 makes it the first row of the joiners' list
       (remote_join.py).
    2  --push: put the packages on the draft release ci-online-test (visible only with write access): the
       AppImage of --appimage (tools/linux/make_appimage.sh or its container step) and a zip of --win-build's
       cm0102_recomp.exe and seasons folder with the game folder. Then push this checkout's commit to the branch online-ci-test (never main). The workflow's push
       trigger starts it with the game name 00S9-CI and the real lobby; the run's id comes from `gh run list`.
       (GitHub starts workflow_dispatch only for a workflow on the default branch, which the 0.6.0 work owns.)
       Without --push the script prints the push command and finds the run in `gh run list` while the host
       waits. Max allowed pushes of online branches (Q43). Before the push the script checks brief rule 10 (no
       commit from before the history rewrite). After the run it deletes the draft release.
    3  The host waits at its Enter Name for --host-wait-minutes (default 45: the build takes about 20 minutes and
       the two joiners join one at a time or together), then types its own names, as in network_run.py.
    4  With a run id (--push, a run found while the host waits, or --run-id): `gh run watch`, then `gh run download`
       into <out>/runner/, and the joiners' dumps are compared with the host's.

Checks:
    1 the host ends with code 0, after the lobby listed its game
    2 the host's traffic log has 2 joiner connections from the relay (0.66.255.<channel>) with packets both ways
    3 each joiner's result.txt ends with "remote join: PASS" (Linux and Windows)
    4 each joiner's three dumps equal the host's: at most 1% of pixels differ
Result: PASS (exit code 0) when all checks pass; FAIL (1) else; WAIT (3) when the build has no relay (slice 5) or
no workflow run took part (the host's checks only).
