"""Match day with two human managers (0.7.0 slice 9): the traffic of a network game that plays days and a match, and
an estimate of the relay's requests on the Cloudflare free plan. Slice 2 measured only the setup screens (research
note, section 11).

Usage:
    python3 tests/online/match_day_run.py <cm0102_recomp> [<game folder>] --keep <folder> [--minutes 25]
        [--via lan|relay] [--lobby-url <address>] [--save <prematch.sav>]

The host restores prematch.sav (tests/fixtures: Test Smoke at Arsenal, 16.7.01, a friendly at Basel on 20.7.01) as
a network game and takes its manager back. One joiner joins (through the LAN address, or the relay with --via
relay), clicks Add Manager, makes a manager with the second club of Select Team and clicks Finish; then the host
clicks Finish and takes Holiday until next match, so that the assistant answers the Henry bid that blocks
Continue Game, and the host is back for the friendly. Then for --minutes both
games repeat their inputs: Space (Continue Game), a click at (45, 120) (Continue Game, and on the match screen
Kick Off, Re-start and Continue Game) and a click at (705, 573) (Yes of "Proceed to the match?"), every 6 s. The
joiner's round (every 10 s) is Space, Yes (705, 573) at once, then (45, 120), then the answer to a bid for its
players (Respond at 172, 230, Reject at 502, 573, then the Yes). Each game
dumps its screen once a minute.

The traffic logs (RECOMP_NET_LOG) give the bytes and packets of each 10 s. The run prints:
    - the host's dates and its match screens (0x718e90) with their times
    - bytes and packets each way: in total, per minute, the busiest 10 s, and during the match
    - the relay messages: with the relay, the frames that the relay lines count; on the LAN, a lower bound (one
      message for each 10 s with bytes, each way) and an upper bound (one for each packet, at most 200 in 10 s,
      the 50 ms batches of slice 5)
Result: PASS when both games end with code 0, the host showed its match screen, the date passed 20.7.01 and the
joiner's connection carried bytes both ways; FAIL else. The figures go to the research note by hand.
