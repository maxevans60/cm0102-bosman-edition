"""Release test 1 of the online play spec (Q29, slice 9): two and four games on this Mac play through the lobby and
the relay.

Usage:
    python3 tests/online/release_mac_run.py <cm0102_recomp> [<game folder>] [--server real|local|<address>]
        [--out <folder>]

--server real (the default) is https://bosman-online.maxvert.workers.dev. local starts a local copy of server/
(`npx wrangler dev`, as tests/smoke/network_run.py --lobby does); use it before a run against the real server.
The game folder defaults to /Users/max/Projects/cm0102/clean-3968. --out defaults to a new folder under
run-logs/s9-tests/.

The runs, each a tests/smoke/network_run.py run in its own folder of --out:
    With the relay in the build (slice 5, the text "recomp: relay: joined" in the program):
        relay-2   --relay --joiners 1: the host and 1 joiner, the joiner sees lobby rows only and joins through
                  the relay
        relay-4   --relay --joiners 3: the host and 3 joiners, the same
    Without it (online-0.7.0 before slice 5), the stage that runs today:
        lobby     --lobby: the host is in the lobby; join1 joins through its row over the LAN; join2 (another
                  version) and join4 (full today) are refused; join3 has Online play off
        lan-4     --joiners 3: the host and 3 joiners over the LAN, no lobby
Each run waits for room first (online_common.wait_for_room: no HOLD file, load under 24, fewer than 15 games, no
network run of another 0.7.0 worktree).

Result (exit code 0, 3, 1):
    PASS     every run passes, the build has the relay and the server is the real one: release test 1 passes
    STAGE    every run passes, but the build has no relay or the server is local: not yet the release test
    FAIL     a run fails (its output is in <out>/<run>.log, its dumps and traffic logs in <out>/<run>/)
