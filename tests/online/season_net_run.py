"""Release test 4 of the online play spec (Q29, slice 9): a four-player network game runs through a World Cup, a
Euros and every season change between them, with a drop and rejoin, a host quit and a version mismatch.

Usage:
    python3 tests/online/season_net_run.py <cm0102_recomp> [<game folder>] --keep <folder> [--start 2001]
        [--end 2004 [--end-days 62] | --seasons n | --days d --legs n] [--nations England|all]
        [--lobby-url <address>] [--via lan|relay] [--seed 1] [--stall-minutes 20] [--timeout 86400] [--slow k]

It is the full play of tests/seasons/full_play_run.py (gate (b) of 0.6.0: the match engine on, the managers on
holiday, a save near each 1 July that a new program loads) with the host's game as a network game of four human
managers. The default, 2001 to about 1 September 2004 (rule O166, as gate_run.py's end year of 2001), crosses the
World Cup 2002, the Euro 2004 and the season changes of 2002, 2003 and 2004. --days d --legs n plays n legs of d
days, for a quick check of the clicks. The lobby is a local copy of server/ (`npx wrangler dev`, as
tests/smoke/network_run.py --lobby), or --lobby-url.

The legs (each in <keep>/legNN, with a user folder and a stderr file for each game):
    leg 0  The host makes the network game "00Season" (Start Network Game) with its manager Host One at Arsenal, no
           password. Three joiners join one at a time and each makes a manager with the password "pw" at the
           2nd, 3rd and 4th club of Select Team. Then:
             drop and rejoin  the script kills join3 at its Manager Status (its socket closes with no quit
                              packet, as when a line drops; its club goes on holiday, research note section 7). A new join3 joins, clicks its old manager's row
                              on Manager Status, types "pw" and takes the club back.
             version          a fifth game of another version (RECOMP_TEST_VERSION=0.0.1) clicks the host's
                              lobby row and gets the box that names the host's version (slice 4b).
           Each joiner clicks Finish, the host clicks Finish, the game starts, and each joiner quits: its club is
           on holiday (Away). The host goes on holiday. At the first human turn --days game days after its first
           (RECOMP_SAVE_AFTER_DAYS, 365 by default), the runtime saves samesave.sav and ends the program.
    leg n  The host restores that save (Restore Network Game, Select File, Ok; setup_assign_restored_network_managers
           0x8387e0 puts its manager, who has no password, on its channel) and takes its manager back on Manager
           Status. The three joiners join again; each clicks its manager's row, types "pw" and takes its club back
           (the password box 0x8230b0). All click Finish; then as leg 0 from "each joiner quits".
    quit   Only with slice 6 in the build ("The host left the game"). The host restores the last save, the
           joiners take their clubs back, all click Finish, and the host quits (a window close) while the joiners
           play. The host's game saves, and each joiner shows "The host left the game" and goes back to the start
           screen.

The joiners play only at the start of each leg: in the original a joiner who goes on holiday leaves the network
game ("Exit the network game as you go on holiday ?", 0x7623da), and a joiner who stays must click Continue Game
for each day. So the host crosses every match day, tournament and season change as a network game host with three
human managers Away, and the joiners connect again in July of each season.

Checks:
    1  each leg: the host ends with code 0 and leaves samesave.sav; no message box of the game in its log (the
       script stops the game at the first one); no stall (the date moves at least once in --stall-minutes)
    2  each leg: every joiner reaches Manager Status with its club (leg 0: makes its manager; leg n: takes its club
       back with its password; its dump is in its log and no wait timed out), and ends with code 0
    3  each leg: the lobby lists the game with the leg's season, and with 4 managers online once all joined
    4  leg 0: after join3's drop the lobby shows one manager online less, and after its rejoin 4 again
    5  leg 0: the fifth game's box names the host's version
    6  all legs: every division moves on from one season to the next (rules_report_check.league_stalls)
    7  the run reaches 1 September of --end (or the last leg of --days)
    8  quit (needs slice 6, "The host left the game" in the build; else it is skipped and the result is STAGE): each
       joiner shows "The host left the game" and then the start screen 0x81bab0; the host saved at its quit
The output ends with PASS (exit code 0: every check, with the relay, slice 6 and the full run to --end), STAGE
(exit code 3: every check that ran passes, but the joins went over the LAN, the quit leg waits for slice 6 or the
run was short) or FAIL (exit code 1). The run waits for room before each game (online_common.wait_for_room).
