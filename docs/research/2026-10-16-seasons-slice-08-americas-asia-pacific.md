# Rules table, slice 8: Argentina, Brazil, the United States, Australia, Japan and South Korea

Slice 8 of `docs/specs/2026-10-16-seasons-0.6.0-spec.md`, researched on 2026-10-16 and 2026-10-17. Brief: `research-brief-0.6.0.md`. The rows cover the seasons 2001/02 to 2027/28 and follow Max's decisions Q268 to Q331 in the spec.

## Files

Each part has its rules table (`<part>.tsv`) and its notes (`<part>.md`, with the sections Reconcile, Loose ends, Source fill, Pass 2, Closing and the second-source sections). The checks are in `<part>.check.tsv` (first check) and `<part>.check2.tsv` (second source of pass 2 and the retry), and the reconcile decisions in `<part>.reconcile.tsv`. Parts with club moves also have `<part>-clubs.tsv`. All files are in `rules-0.6.0/`. The process is in the `league-research` skill.

## Counts

Field verdicts count the latest verdict of each checked field of a row that still exists. "No second source" includes fields that hold `unknown`. "Without a source" counts filled fields whose row cites no page for them (`tools/research/rules_lint.py`). "Club rows not in the database" includes the reserve and B teams that the build adds as new clubs (Q289).

| Part | Rows | Agree | Disagree (settled or listed) | Found | No second source | Unknown fields | Without a source | Club rows | Club rows not in the database |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [bra](rules-0.6.0/bra.md) | 1053 | 2455 | 37 | 111 | 1072 | 2156 | 0 | 1649 | 65 |
| [arg-usa](rules-0.6.0/arg-usa.md) | 324 | 1001 | 17 | 43 | 499 | 460 | 0 | 1438 | 48 |
| [aus-jap-kor](rules-0.6.0/aus-jap-kor.md) | 378 | 1068 | 24 | 0 | 622 | 526 | 0 | 1258 | 13 |

## Method

1. An Opus agent wrote the rows of each part from pages read on the day.
2. A second Opus agent checked every filled field against a page of another publisher.
3. A third Opus agent read a third source for each disagreement and wrote the settled values into the table.
4. Loose-ends, consistency and source-fill agents closed the points the earlier agents found.
5. Pass 2 applied Max's decisions: no new tiers (Q331) and no new nations (Q288), conflicts settled by what happened in real life, club moves down every tier, and reserve teams listed.
6. A second-source agent and a retry looked for a second publisher for every fact that only one publisher stated.

The open questions for Max are in `2026-10-16-seasons-research-for-max.md`.
