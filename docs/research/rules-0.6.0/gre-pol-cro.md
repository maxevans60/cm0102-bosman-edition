# Rules table part gre-pol-cro: Greece, Poland and Croatia (slice 7)

Research for release 0.6.0. Date: 2026-10-16. Files:

- `gre-pol-cro.tsv`: 486 rows, 18 competitions x 27 seasons (2001/02 to 2027/28).
- `gre-pol-cro-clubs.tsv`: 1,634 club rows for the divisions whose real size differs from the season database.
- This file: method, decisions, missing clubs and unknowns.

## Scope

| comp_file | Competition | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| gre_prm | Alpha Ethniki, Super League Greece, Super League 1 (tier 1) | 14, 16, 18, then 14 with a split from 2019/20 |

Out of scope: the third tiers (Gamma Ethniki, Polish II liga from 2008/09, Croatian 3. HNL groups). The original runs no league code for them.

## Method

- English Wikipedia season pages, read raw (`action=raw`) on 2026-10-16. A script read the sports-table templates (club order, result keys) and the round tables of the cups. Where a season page holds its table in a template, the template page is the source.
- RSSSF season pages for the Polish second tier 2002/03 to 2006/07, which have no English Wikipedia page.
- Polish Wikipedia for the 2001/02 Polish League Cup and the Polish top-flight name (I liga to 2007/08, Ekstraklasa from 2008/09).
- Foreign-player rules: a comparative quota paper dated 30 May 2008 (rdes.it), the HFF transfer regulations of June 2022, the HNS competition rules of 2020, and news pages (insideworldfootball.com, sportowefakty.wp.pl, prawosportowe.pl, soccerway.com, index.hr, gameofthepeople.com). The PDFs were read as text with pdftotext. The news pages were read through WebFetch with a request for verbatim quotes.
- `up` and `down` are direct places. Where the table key shows extra demotions or withdrawals, the field holds the planned count and the notes give the real outcome. Where the planned count is not clear, the field is `unknown` and the notes give the real outcome.
- Club matching: real names matched to database names by a script (normalised tokens, fuzzy match, a short list of name overrides, reserve teams only to reserve records). Matches below the threshold are left empty.

## Decisions taken in the table

1. **Greek tier 2 in two groups.** The database has one Greek second division. In two-group seasons the `gre_second` row holds the North group and a `new` row holds the South group. In one-group seasons the `new` row says `not held`.
2. **Croatian tier 2.** The database has two second divisions (North and South). From 2006/07 the real tier 2 is one league. `cro_a2a` holds it and `cro_a2b` says `not held`. The 16 database clubs of the South division then have no real division. Max decides where they go.
3. **Super cups that a double cancels.** The Croatian Super Cup is not played when one club wins the double. Those seasons keep the format with "(real: not played this season)", because the game decides the double itself. The Greek Super Cup was abolished from 2008/09 to 2024/25, so those rows say `not held`. The Polish Super Cup plays the cup runner-up after a double from 2016 (the 2013 match was not played after a double).
4. **Substitutes.** 3 used to 2019/20. 5 from 2020/21. Only Poland has a league source for 2020/21. For Greece and Croatia the 5 is an inference from the IFAB rule. Bench size is `unknown` except Croatia 2020/21 (7 named substitutes, HNS rules 2020).
5. **Transfer windows.** From 2002/03 to 2022/23 the rows give the FIFA frame (two registration periods, 12 weeks and 4 weeks at most). From 2023/24 the rows give the RSTP March 2023 frame (8 to 12 weeks and 4 to 8 weeks, 16 weeks together), and the national dates where a federation or league page gives them (see Reconcile). 2001/02 is `unknown`.
6. **2027/28.** No season pages exist yet. The rows carry 2026/27 and say "inference".
7. **Database names.** The two databases with an extra word in the folder name appear as "October 2003" and "September 2005".

## Missing clubs (Q244)

Real clubs that the script found in no club record of that nation in the season database. Some may exist under another name. Max decides.

Other points for Max:

- 145 matched clubs come from the nation's "Lower Division" record, not from clubs with no division. Clubs with no division exist only in some databases: Poland 23 to 41 in November 2007 to September 2012, Croatia 3 to 7 in November 2007 to September 2011, Greece 0 or 1. In other seasons Q244 cannot be met as written.
- Short divisions: the database has 16 Croatian first-division clubs against 12 or 10 real clubs from 2002/03 (except 2009/10 to 2011/12), and 14 Greek first-division clubs against 16 or 18 real clubs from 2007/08 to 2018/19. The clubs file lists the real clubs. The surplus database clubs need a division.
- Greek tier 2 in 2021/22 to 2025/26 has 20 to 34 real clubs against 16 in the database, and B teams that the database lacks.
- Club matches are by name. A reviewer should check the pairs with a changed club name (for example Dospel Katowice to GKS Katowice, GKS Bogdanka to Górnik Łęczna, Sesvete to NK Radnik Sesvete).

## Unknowns

- Greek, Polish and Croatian bench sizes in nearly all seasons.
- Foreign-player rules for Greece 2001/02 to 2006/07 and 2009/10 to 2019/20, Poland 2001/02 to 2006/07, Croatia 2001/02 to 2006/07, 2008/09 to 2014/15, 2017/18 to 2019/20 and 2021/22 to 2024/25. The original game's values (Greece 4 non-EU, Poland 5, Croatia 4) come from the repo doc `docs/research/2026-10-16-season-change-points.md`, not from a web source.
- Work permits and squad registration: no source found, except the Greek non-EU declaration dates (2020/21 to 2022/23).
- National transfer window dates, except Greece 2025/26 and Poland (Ekstraklasa) 2023/24 winter to 2025/26.
- Cup entrant counts for the Polish Cup except 2014/15 (86) and 2015/16 (68).
- Planned relegation counts for several seasons with demotions or withdrawals (notes give the real outcome).
- The year in which the Greek over-23 non-EU cap moved from 5 to 6.

## Reconcile

Reconcile date 2026-10-16. The full list is in `gre-pol-cro.reconcile.tsv` (53 rows: 28 disputed fields, 19 found values, 5 follow-on fields and 1 removed claim). I changed 44 rows of `gre-pol-cro.tsv`, added each new URL to `sources` and kept row order and ids. Third sources: Kathimerini, Ta Nea, Sportowe Fakty, 90minut.pl, the Ekstraklasa SA site, the FIFA RSTP of March 2023, the Druga HNL competition rules of 2017/18 (archived PDF) and Polish and Croatian Wikipedia. Polish and Croatian Wikipedia are not fully separate publishers from English Wikipedia. I used them only where I found no other text.

| Decision | Fields |
|---|---|
| first | 3 (gre-pol-cro-6 format, 254 down, 368 playoffs) |
| second | 22 (15 `windows` fields, 166 and 167 format, 197 playoffs, 249 up and playoffs, 366 and 367 down) |
| conflict | 3 (66 down, 160 foreign, 361 down) |
| found value accepted | 11 (65, 72, 73, 75, 77, 129, 131, 195, 196, 249, 369, all `down`) |
| found value changed to the planned value | 4 (74, 76, 130, 362 `down`) |
| found value rejected | 4 (250 up, 359 up, 360 up, 363 down) |
| follow-on | 5 (195, 196, 251 playoffs; 250 down and playoffs) |
| claim removed | 1 (459 format) |

How I decided:

- Greek Cup 2006/07 (6): Kathimerini of 16 November 2006 says the round of 16 is one match with a replay only after a draw. RSSSF lists the replays as second legs.
- Transfer windows (158 to 162, 320 to 324, 482 to 486): article 6.2 of the RSTP March 2023 edition sets 8 to 12 weeks and 4 to 8 weeks, 16 weeks together. I did not read a later edition. Where the national body published the dates, the row gives them. Greece 2025/26: HFF executive committee decision reported by Ta Nea (9 April 2025), summer 1 July to 12 September 2025 and winter 2 January to 6 February 2026. Poland: Ekstraklasa SA pages, winter 2024 29 January to 27 February, summer 2024 1 July to 6 September, winter 2025 28 January to 24 February, summer 2025 1 July to 8 September, winter 2026 26 January to 25 February. I found no HFF dates for other seasons and no HNS dates. Croatian press dates for 2025 and 2026 disagree with each other, so I did not use them.
- Polish Cup 2004/05 and 2005/06 (166, 167): 90minut.pl shows the group phase of 2004/05 and the two-legged rounds of both seasons. The Wikipedia season pages agree with this. The first value came from the general cup page.
- Ekstraklasa 2008/09 (197, 251): the 14th was to play the I liga 3rd. Sportowe Fakty (12 June 2009) reports that PZPN cancelled it.
- II liga 2006/07 and 2007/08 (249, 250) and the top level of the same seasons (195, 196): Polish Wikipedia gives the plan of each season (1st and 2nd up, 3rd v top-level 14th, last four down). RSSSF and a 90minut.pl report (5 June 2007) show that the corruption demotions changed the outcome. The rows now hold the plan and the notes the outcome.
- I liga 2011/12 (254): the rule was four down. Only three went down because Ruch Radzionkow withdrew.
- Druga HNL 2015/16 and 2016/17 (366, 367): Croatian Wikipedia says the last two go down, and both RSSSF and the English infobox show 11th and 12th relegated.
- Druga HNL 2017/18 (368): the competition rules (articles 38 and 39) give 2nd v HNL 9th, B teams skipped, and 11th v the 3. HNL South runner-up. RSSSF shows the outcome (3rd Varazdin in the play-off, no relegation play-off).
- Found values: I accepted a value where the RSSSF page states the rule or draws the relegation line. Where the value was only the outcome, I wrote the planned value from the same page or kept `unknown`, with the outcome in `notes`.
- Croatian Super Cup 2027/28 (459): I removed "(real: not played this season)". The result depends on 2026/27.

Conflicts for Max:

- gre-pol-cro-66 (Football League 2012/13, down). First value 3 (bottom three), from the prose of the season page. Second value 2: RSSSF and the table key of the same page mark only 20th and 21st, and 19th Pierikos stayed. The league proclamation (epae.org, article 8) has no 2012/13 copy in the web archive. The tier went to two groups in 2013/14, which may explain the change. The value stays 3.
- gre-pol-cro-160 (Greece 2025/26, foreign). First value: at most 5 non-EU on the field, squad cap of 6 non-EU over 23 (Insideworldfootball, July 2026, which says the cap rose from six to seven). Second value: 7 non-EU per squad (Sportmonks, 17 December 2025, no age split). I found no HFF text for 2025/26. The value stays as first.
- gre-pol-cro-361 (Druga HNL 2010/11, down). First value 4 (13th-16th): the season page cites the CFF Assembly of 17 December 2010. Second value 1 (16th): RSSSF quotes a licence rule that only 15th or better may remain. In the end 15th was expelled and 16th dissolved. The value stays 4.

Club matches (`gre-pol-cro-clubs.tsv`):

- 2003/04 cro_a2b, Pula 1856: now 12006 "NK Uljanik". The club history on Wikipedia gives NK Uljanik, then NK Pula 1856, Pula Staro Cesko and Istra 1961. RSSSF 2002/03 lists both Istra Pula and Uljanik Pula, and RSSSF 2003/04 lists Pula 1856 as the promoted group winner. In the October 2003 database 12006 sits in the Croatian First Division, so it is not a club with no division (Q244).
- 2014/15 gre_second, Serres: now 3098 "Ethnikos Gazoros". RSSSF 2014/15: "Ethnikos Gazoros were renamed Serres FC". The English season page links the club as Ethnikos Gazoros.
- 2012/13 gre_second, Ethnikos Gazoros: now 13274 "E.S Ethnikos Gazorou Serres" (September 2012 database). The script had matched it to Ethnikos Patron (3694). I found this one while checking Serres.

Other points:

- gre-pol-cro-452 (Croatian Super Cup 2020/21) keeps "(real: not played this season)". The check found that the cause was no free date, not a double. The row is correct on the outcome.
- The Croatian under-21 rule from 2026/27 (check file) is not in rows 485 and 486. It was not a disagreement, so I left it.

## Source fill

Date: 2026-10-16. A source-fill pass added `field=URL` entries to `sources` for filled fact fields that had none. It changed no values and kept row order and ids. Each URL was read on this date, and the value was checked against the page text.

Method:

- For `name`, the pass took the pages that the row already cites, season pages first, and kept the first page that contains the name. For a name with a note in brackets, the base name had to match. For an Italian group (girone), the page also had to name that group.
- For a value of `none` in `split` or `playoffs`, the source is the season page with one league stage and no championship or relegation round.

Fields filled:

- `name`: 148 rows. The not-held Polish League Cup rows (2002/03 to 2005/06, 2009/10 to 2027/28) cite the Ekstraklasa Cup page, which names the Polish League Cup. The Druga HNL South rows from 2006/07 cite the First Football League (Croatia) page, which names the southern second league.
- `clubs` = 2 for the super cups: 19 rows (Greek and Croatian Super Cup pages, infobox "Teams 2").
- `split` = `none`: 5 rows.
- `format` and `split` of gre-pol-cro-261 (I liga 2018/19): the Polish Wikipedia season page ("34 kolejki ligowe", two halves, no split).

No source found for `name` in 19 rows: gre-pol-cro-109 to gre-pol-cro-120, gre-pol-cro-123 to gre-pol-cro-128 and gre-pol-cro-134. The value "second group of the Greek second tier" is a label for a not-held group, and no page uses it. Each row has "no source found for name" in `notes`.

Disagreements: none found.

Lint after the pass: 19 problems (the 19 names above).

## Pass 2

Date: 2026-10-17. Decision agent, by the rules of Q268 to Q331. Row ids and row order stay. Lint after the pass: 0 problems (0 before).

### No new tiers and no new nations (Q331, Q288)

The original runs tiers 1 and 2 for Greece (`gre_prm`, `gre_second`), Poland (`pol_first`, `pol_second`) and Croatia (`cro_a1`, `cro_a2a`, `cro_a2b`). The table and the clubs file hold no competition below tier 2 and none that needs another nation. I deleted 0 rows and 0 club rows. The Croatian third divisions in the databases are spare divisions. Their clubs are part of the pool for club moves. The Croatian South division (`cro_a2b`) already says `not held` from 2006/07.

### Conflicts settled (Q278, Q297 to Q327)

| Row | Field | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| gre-pol-cro-66 (Football League 2012/13) | down | 2 (20th and 21st), was 3 | RSSSF ([grk2013](https://www.rsssf.org/tablesg/grk2013.html)) and the table keys of the English and the [Greek season page](https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/Β΄_Εθνική_ποδοσφαίρου_ανδρών_2012-13) mark two places. The Greek page says Thrasyvoulos and Anagennisi Epanomi went down. The three-down text in the English prose is the general league text. No rule text exists in the web archive. |
| gre-pol-cro-160 (Greece 2025/26) | foreign | first value kept (5 non-EU on the field, 6 non-EU over 23 in the squad) | [Insideworldfootball, 6 July 2026](https://www.insideworldfootball.com/2026/07/06/greek-super-league-increases-squad-cap-on-foreign-players-to-7/) says the cap rose from six to seven in July 2026. The Sportmonks glossary value of seven matches the later rule. I found no HFF text for 2025/26 and no third publisher. |
| gre-pol-cro-361 (Druga HNL 2010/11) | down | 5 (12th to 16th), was 4 | At the season start the top flight was to go from 16 to 12 clubs, with the Druga HNL winner up and five clubs down ([season page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010–11_Croatian_Second_Football_League), citing Prva-HNL.hr of 29 December 2010). The CFF Assembly of 17 December 2010 and the plenum of 14 February 2011 changed this to 3 up and 4 down. Q278 keeps the value at the season start, which also agrees with `up` = 1. The notes give the change and the outcome. |

### Open points of the first pass, settled

- Clubs from the "Lower Division" records (first pass, 145 clubs): allowed by Q279.
- Surplus database clubs of short divisions (Croatian First Division from 2002/03, Greek tiers): they become clubs with no division and stay in the pool (Q279).
- The 16 clubs of the Croatian Second Division South from 2006/07: clubs with no division (Q290).
- Club pairs with a changed name (Dospel Katowice to GKS Katowice, GKS Bogdanka to Górnik Łęczna, Sesvete to Radnik Sesvete, and the other pairs whose names share no word): I read every pair. All are the same club.
- Super cups after a double, and the 2027/28 rows: no change. They are rules of the season, and the game decides the double itself.

### Club moves (Q279, Q280, Q290)

I went down every tier of each season with a database, with the pool of clubs with no division, lower and spare divisions (also the cross-nation "A Lower Division" and "A Premier Division" records that hold clubs of these nations) and the ended Croatian South division.

Fixes to existing club rows (32):

- 27 real clubs now have a database record from the pool. Examples: Olympiacos B (6378, then 11277), OFI 2014/15 (8109 "Omilos Filathlon Irakleiou"), Kerkyra 2007/08 (5917), Panetolikos 2009/10 and 2010/11 (8557), Aiginiakos 2016/17 and 2017/18 (310), Panegialios (311), Aluminium Konin (5731, called "KP Konin" in the 3.9.68 data), Inker or Inter Zaprešić (5290 "NK INKER").
- Inference (name and database division agree, town not in the data): Apollon Smyrnis 2001/02 to 778 "Apollon Athens", MCP Bielsko-Biala 2002/03 to 8859 "MC Podbeskidzie Bielsko-Biala", Omladinac Novo Selo Rok 2002/03 to 8279 "NK Omladinac", Sloga Nova Gradiška 2002/03 and 2003/04 to 10676 "NK Sloga", Graničar Županja 2005/06 to 4545 "NK Granicar", Heko Czermno 2005/06 to 634 (the September 2005 data also holds a second record, 13223).
- Ethnikos Piraeus 2007/08 to 2010/11: the first pass matched it to 3688 "Ethnikos Asteras", which is another club in the same list. The match is now empty.
- Olympiacos Volos 2021/22: was 7603 "Volos NPS" (a top-flight club of that season). Now 8254 "Olympiakos Volou".

New club rows (32), where a tier above took clubs from a tier whose count matched:

- 2005/06 `pol_first`, 16 clubs ([2005–06 Ekstraklasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005–06_Ekstraklasa)). The database top flight holds Górnik Polkowice, Ruch Chorzów and Szczakowianka Jaworzno, which played in tier 2.
- 2018/19 `gre_second`, 16 clubs ([2018–19 Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018–19_Football_League_(Greece))). Apollon Smyrnis and Lamia went up from the database tier 2. Aittitos Spata and Sparti withdrew during the season and stay in the list.

The clubs file now has 1,666 rows. Real clubs with no record in that season's database (not reserve teams). The build fills these places from the pool. I don't know which pool club fits best, so Max decides if he wants a rule:

| Season | Division | Clubs |
|---|---|---|
| 2002/03 | cro_a2a | Valpovka |
| 2002/03 | cro_a2b | TŠK Topolovac |
| 2003/04 | cro_a2a | Međimurje (3.9.68 lineage: record 2128 "NK Cakovec" is matched to Čakovec), Valpovka |
| 2005/06 | cro_a2a | Čakovec |
| 2005/06 | cro_a2b | Naftaš Ivanić Grad |
| 2005/06 | pol_second | Zawisza Bydgoszcz, Drwęca Nowe Miasto Lubawskie |
| 2007/08 to 2010/11 | gre_second | Ethnikos Piraeus |
| 2009/10 | cro_a2a | Rudeš |
| 2010/11 | cro_a2a | Dugopolje |
| 2011/12 | gre_second | Iraklis Psachna |
| 2013/14 | gre_second | Vataniakos |
| 2014/15 | group 2 | Alimos |
| 2016/17 | gre_prm | Kerkyra |
| 2023/24 | gre_second, group 2 | Aiolikos, Tilikratis |

### Reserve and B teams (Q289)

The build adds these as new club records:

| Team | Seasons | Division | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dinamo Zagreb II | 2015/16, 2016/17, 2017/18 | cro_a2a | the data holds only 3259 "GNK Dinamo Zagreb U19" (a youth record) |
| Hajduk Split II | 2017/18 | cro_a2a | the October 2017 data holds 459 "HNK Hajduk Split u19", which is "HNK Hajduk Split II" from October 2018 |
| Asteras Tripolis B | 2024/25 (group 2), 2025/26 | gre_second | no B record |

Olympiacos B, PAOK B, AEK Athens B, Panathinaikos B, Osijek II and the later Dinamo Zagreb II and Hajduk Split II have records.

## Second source, pass 2

Date: 2026-10-17. Second-source agent. The check file has 823 lines with the verdict `no second source`. I checked the 164 lines whose field holds a value, and wrote them to `gre-pol-cro.check2.tsv`. I did not check these 659 lines:

- 530 fields that hold `unknown`, and 2 that start with "unknown" (gre-pol-cro-25 and 26 `clubs`).
- 6 fields whose value is an inference.
- 121 fields whose row notes call the value an inference: the 2027/28 rows carried from 2026/27, the 2026/27 Croatian Cup, the 5-substitute rows from 2022/23, row 27 `subs_used` and the Greek `foreign` fields of 2021/22, 2023/24 and 2024/25.

Counts:

| Verdict | Lines |
|---|---|
| agree | 83 |
| disagree, settled | 1 |
| disagree, still split | 0 |
| no second source | 80 |

Second publishers: RSSSF, 90minut.pl, HNS Semafor (the COMET match records of the HNS), ESPN, the PAOK club site and the FIFA Laws of the Game (2010/11 and 2017/18 editions, read in the web archive). The web search budget ran out during the pass. After that I read only pages whose address I already had.

How I decided:

- Substitutes 2001/02 to 2016/17, second tiers of Greece and Poland (34 lines): Law 3 of the 2010/11 Laws allows three substitutes in every official competition of a member association. The 2017/18 edition gives the same text as the old text. For seasons other than 2010/11, the edition I read is not the edition of that season.
- I liga 2017/18 to 2019/20 (3 lines): I read 38 match reports of each season on 90minut.pl. No team used more than three substitutes. This is evidence of use, because the Laws of 2017/18 let the PZPN allow five below the top level.
- Five substitutes, 2020/21 and 2021/22: a match report with four or five substitutes for one team shows that the five-substitute option applied. I found one for the Polish leagues, cup and Super Cup (90minut.pl), the Croatian HNL, Druga HNL and cup (HNS Semafor), the Greek Super League (ESPN) and the 2021 Greek Cup final (PAOK). The row notes of these 17 rows still call the value an inference. Max or the lead can drop that word from the notes. I did not change the notes. I found no data for the Greek Cup 2021/22 or Super League 2.
- 2026/27 rows: the 90minut.pl pages of the Ekstraklasa, the I liga and the Polish Cup, the HNS Semafor pages of the HNL and the Prva NL and the ESPN Greek Super League table confirm the club counts, rounds and table zones. Down places and play-offs of the Croatian rows have no second source. The 90minut.pl zones come from the table colours, because the page has no legend.
- Polish Cup 2014/15 (176): 90minut.pl names the entrants of each round, 16 + 36 + 18 + 16 = 86.
- Greek Cup 2004/05 (4): RSSSF shows 32 two-legged ties and 2 supplementary ties with 2 new clubs, so 66 entrants.
- Croatian Cup 2009/10 (414): HNS Semafor shows 48 clubs.
- Druga HNL 2018/19 (369, playoffs): RSSSF marks 2nd Šibenik "promotion play-off" against Istra 1961, and HNS Semafor holds "Kvalifikacije za 1. HNL 2019". The first check missed this.
- Bench size (344, 371, 425): the only text is the HNS rules, and HNS Semafor is the same publisher. No second source.

Change to `gre-pol-cro.tsv`:

- gre-pol-cro-375 (Prva NL 2024/25), `playoffs`: was "11th: relegation play-off", now "none". Decision: second. The [RSSSF page](https://www.rsssf.org/tablesk/kroa2025.html) states the licence rule that clubs placed 11th or better may play in the First league next season, and it marks only 12th as demoted. Third source: [HNS Semafor](https://semafor.hns.family/natjecanja/88814659/supersport-prva-nl/), the organiser's record, holds no men's Prva NL play-off competition for 2024/25. The English season page has a "Relegation play-off" line between 11th and 12th but names no play-off. I added both URLs to `sources` and the reason to `notes`. Row ids and row order stay. Row 374 (2023/24) has the same play-off value. I did not check it, because its check line was not part of this task.

Lint after the pass: 0 problems (0 before).

## Closing

Date: 2026-10-17. Closing agent. `rules_lint.py`: 0 problems before and after.

- gre-pol-cro-374 (Prva NL 2023/24), `playoffs`: the value stays a relegation play-off and now reads "11th v the 2. NL runner-up, two legs". Unlike 2024/25 (row 375), the play-off took place: Kustošija Zagreb v Orijent Rijeka 1:2 and 1:2, and Orijent stayed up. RSSSF marks Orijent "relegation play-off; remain" (https://www.rsssf.org/tablesk/kroa2024.html, read on 2026-10-17).
- Five substitutes, 2020/21 and 2021/22: I removed the word "inference" from the notes of the 17 rows whose `subs_used` has an `agree` match report in `gre-pol-cro.check2.tsv`: rows 20, 47, 48, 182, 183, 209, 210, 263, 264, 290, 291, 344, 345, 371, 372, 425 and 426. Each row now cites its match report as a `subs_used` source. I fetched each report again on 2026-10-17. The 8 Polish reports (90minut.pl) list more than 6 substitutes in all, so at least one team used more than 3. Rows 21, 74, 75 and 129 keep the inference, because no report was found.

## Second source, retry

Date: 2026-10-17. Second-source retry agent. I took the 80 lines of `gre-pol-cro.check2.tsv` with the verdict `no second source` and tried again. I updated the verdict, `second_url` and note of each line in place. I used 8 web searches. The main new publisher is Transfermarkt: cup participant lists, league tables with zone colours, fixture lists and match sheets. Other pages: the HFF site and its cup rule texts (archive copies), and HNS Semafor match sheets as the primary record.

Counts for the 80 lines:

| Verdict | Lines |
|---|---|
| agree | 45 |
| disagree, settled | 4 |
| disagree, still split | 1 |
| no second source | 30 |

After the retry the whole check2 file has 128 agree, 6 disagree (5 from this retry and 1 from pass 2) and 30 no second source.

Agreements:

- Greek Cup `clubs`, 15 seasons (2005/06 to 2007/08, 2010/11 to 2019/20, 2023/24 and 2024/25): the Transfermarkt participant list gives the same count.
- Greek Cup 2021/22 `subs_used`: the HFF cup rule text allows five substitutions.
- Beta Ethniki 2005/06 (59), six fields: the Transfermarkt table.
- Greek second tier `subs_used` 2017/18 to 2021/22 (71 to 75, 129): Transfermarkt match sheets. Up to 2019/20 no team used more than 3. From 2020/21 teams used 5.
- 2026/27 rows: Super League 1 name and Greek Cup name (HFF site), Super League 2 (80, seven fields, Transfermarkt), Super Cup 2026 (107, HFF report of 13 August 2026), HNL `down` and `playoffs` (350) and Prva NL `up`, `down` and `playoffs` (377) from the Transfermarkt zone colours.

Changes to `gre-pol-cro.tsv` (also in `gre-pol-cro.reconcile.tsv`):

- gre-pol-cro-344, 371 and 425 (HNL, Druga HNL and Croatian Cup 2020/21), `bench`: was 7, now 9. Decision: second. The HNS rules 2020 (article 35) allow 7 substitutes on the match sheet. Transfermarkt line-ups and the HNS Semafor match sheets of 2020/21 list 9 substitutes for a team. I replaced the bench source with both pages and added the reason to `notes`. The rows of 2019/20 and 2021/22 hold `unknown` for `bench`, so no other row copies the value.
- gre-pol-cro-21 (Greek Cup 2021/22), `clubs`: stays 128. Decision: first. The HFF cup rule text plans 82 + 32 + 14 = 128 entrants. Fewer clubs entered: Transfermarkt lists 122, and the Wikipedia round table gives 119 new entries. I added the rule text to `sources` and the actual entry to `notes`.

Conflict (sources stay split):

- gre-pol-cro-22 (Greek Cup 2022/23), `clubs`: Wikipedia gives 85, Transfermarkt 84, and the HFF draft rule text plans 53 + 26 + 14 = 93. The value stays 85. Max decides.

Still no second source (30 lines):

- Labels and not-held values with no page: 134 (2), 243 (2), 404, 405 (2), 459 (3).
- Druga HNL 2011/12 `up` (362): the Transfermarkt table shows only the outcome.
- Croatian Cup 2004/05 and 2008/09 `clubs` (409, 413): the Transfermarkt lists hold only 2 clubs.
- Greek `foreign` and `registration` (142, 143, 155, 156, 157; 7 lines): efsyn.gr (18 November 2018) states the Super League 1 non-EU rule for 2018/19 only.
- Polish `foreign` 2007/08 to 2012/13 (304 to 309): a Sejm committee record states "no limit" for 2021/22 only.
- Croatian `foreign` (466, 474, 475, 479): no other publisher found.

Lint after the retry: 0 problems (0 before).
