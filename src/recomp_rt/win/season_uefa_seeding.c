/* The UEFA places of each club from the access list by association rank (0.6.0 slice 23, Q369: from 2009/10;
 * season_uefa.h). Evidence: docs/research/2026-10-18-uefa-2009-2020.md.
 *
 * The original. Uefa_Seeding::update_season 0x9035a0 (thiscall, this at [0xde1f58]) runs once a year, at the
 * first of the three UEFA cups that makes or starts its season (their constructors 0x583881, 0x63304d,
 * 0x902377 and start_new_season 0x584e56, 0x6339df, 0x902fac; this+0x439 holds the year). It sorts the nations
 * by coefficient (roll_coefficients 0x903b50: the 0x12-byte entries at this+0, count this+0x438, entry index =
 * rank, 0 the top), makes a 12-byte record of each European club (collect_european_clubs 0x904040, club +0x1db
 * set to -1, sorted by nation, division and league position, 0x905ce0), then gives the places with three
 * functions, each thiscall (records, short count) ret 8 with one caller: assign_champions_league_places
 * 0x904210 (0x90375d), assign_uefa_cup_places 0x904580 (0x90376a) and assign_intertoto_places 0x904e30
 * (0x903777). They write club +0x1db (the record id of the cup: [0x9cf6e8], [0x9cf6f0], [0x9cf6f8]) and +0x1df
 * (the entry code) and count each club in entry +0x11 (the coefficient divisor, 0x903c00). Their places come
 * from rank brackets in the code, not from entry +0xc and +0xd. Those two are read only by get_nation_places
 * 0x905c60 (the league table marks 0x6853f5, the Serie A play-offs 0x641af7, the board 0x6a3a32).
 *
 * This file. In a season of the access list (season_uefa_access_places gives places for the row of the season),
 * the wrap of 0x904210 gives every Champions League and Europa League place, and the wraps of 0x904580 and
 * 0x904e30 give none (the Intertoto Cup is not held: no club gets its id, and the English volunteer list at
 * this+0x43b is freed as 0x904fc0..0x904fe1 does). Other seasons, the base game and RECOMP_SEASON_CODE=off call
 * the original's functions.
 *
 * The places, in this order:
 *   1. the Champions League places of each nation by league position (the p-th club of its records,
 *      0x9050d0 with skip placed 0, as 0x904465), with the entry round of the access list.
 *   2. the Champions League title holder (the history winner of the cup, 0x4afd80 as 0x9042e3) in the group
 *      stage, when it has no place yet. Else its place is free (the cascade of step 6 fills it).
 *   3. the Europa League title holder: from 2015/16 a Champions League place ("X" rows), before a Europa League
 *      group place ("H" rows), when it has no place yet.
 *   4. the Europa League places of each nation: the first the domestic cup winner (the cup of the league
 *      table entry, 0xb63d7e, as 0x9047e2: the winner, else the runner-up), the last the league cup winner for the
 *      nations of the "L" rows (0xb63d82, as 0x904ad8), the others the first club with no place (0x9050d0 with
 *      skip placed 1).
 *   5. the fair play places (to 2015/16): three nations at random (0x90cfc0, as 0x904670) get one Europa League
 *      place more.
 *   6. the cascade: the number of new clubs of each entry round must be the number the round sizes of the row
 *      give (season_uefa_new_clubs). From the group stage down, a round with too many clubs moves its
 *      lowest-ranked club down one round of its path, and a round with too few takes the best-ranked club of
 *      the rounds below in its path (the group stage first from the Champions Path: the access lists give the
 *      free place to the best-ranked champion). The lowest round gives up its extra clubs, and fills a gap with
 *      the first club with no place of the best-ranked nations (as the UEFA Cup's fillers of 0x902cb0).
 *   Slice 24, part b (2021/22 on): after step 4 the Conference League places of each nation ("k" rows): the
 *      first the cup winner when the nation has no Europa League place, the last the league cup winner for the
 *      nations of the "M" rows, the others the first club with no place. The Conference League title holder
 *      gets a Europa League group place ("Y" rows, 2022/23 on) or a Conference League place ("K" rows) when it
 *      has no place yet. Step 6 runs for the Conference League too, on one path. These places come only when the
 *      game has the Conference League record (season_uefa_ecl_id), and its id is the club's +0x1db.
 * Each club gets +0x1db and the entry code of season_uefa.h (SEASON_UEFA_CL_*, SEASON_UEFA_EL_*,
 * SEASON_UEFA_ECL_*), and its nation entry +0x11 one more. Entry +0xc and +0xd get the nation's league places of the list (the table
 * marks), +0xe 0. */
