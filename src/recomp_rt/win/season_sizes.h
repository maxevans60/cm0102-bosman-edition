/* League sizes, promotion and relegation in existing divisions (0.6.0 slice 18; spec
 * docs/specs/2026-10-16-seasons-0.6.0-spec.md, Q247, Q272, Q281). Research and evidence:
 * docs/research/2026-10-18-league-sizes.md.
 *
 * Only a season game (season_game_changes, slice 15) gets any of it. The base game and RECOMP_SEASON_CODE=off
 * keep the original's counts.
 *
 * The rules of a league in a season: the row of the rules table (season_rules.h) of its source file. A new
 * game, and every season of a game with changing rules off, takes the row of the start season (Q232). With
 * changing rules on a later season takes the row of the edition that the object holds (+0x40): the row whose
 * real season begins with that year (a calendar-year league holds edition Y + 1 in the row of season Y), else
 * the row of that season. After the last row the last row stays (Q248).
 *
 * - Club counts: a class holds no more clubs than its largest constant (its table and date template are made
 *   for that count, tools/recomp/league_sizes.py CAPS), and no fewer than its own count where a cup of the
 *   nation needs the whole division (FLOORS; the cups are slice 21). The club moves of a new game (season_clubs.c) fill each division of tools/recomp/league_sizes.py
 *   to the count of its start season row. create_table then takes the clubs that the division holds
 *   (rt_league_clubs, the patched stores of league_sizes.py). In later seasons the game's own results decide who
 *   moves (Q247), so a division holds the count that promotion and relegation give it. With a new count the
 *   matches per club (+0xa7) go back to -1, so League::check_complete 0x689ad0 counts them again (most classes
 *   keep the first season's value, 0x689b1d..0x689b36). The French classes get a date template of the rounds
 *   of their count (rt_league_dates).
 * - Promotion and relegation places: after each set_up_rules (season_size_wraps.c) the places of the row. A
 *   row's count can hold the winner of a play-off that the class plays (the rules report reads it the same way),
 *   so the direct places are the count less one when the class has play-off places.
 * - league_promote_and_relegate 0x689c80 moves the clubs in pairs in most leagues, and its callers pass the
 *   expected counts (4 and 4 for Serie A and B at 0x642476). When the places of two divisions differ (a size
 *   change), the runtime moves each club on its own and drops the expected counts, so the sizes change as the
 *   real transition season did (Q247, Q281).
 * - News: one sentence for a league whose club count or places change in a season (season_change.h). */
