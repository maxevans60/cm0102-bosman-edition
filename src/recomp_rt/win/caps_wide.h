/* International caps and goals above 255 (0.6.2 slice 12, fault 30, Q25, and item 66; caps_wide.c,
 * tools/recomp/caps_wide.py).
 *
 * The original keeps a player's caps in the unsigned byte at staff +0x22. NationalTeams::record_international_result
 * 0x76b600 raises it with no check (0x76b8c8 mov al, [esi + 0x22] / 0x76b8ce inc al / 0x76b8d0 mov [esi + 0x22], al),
 * so the 256th cap gives 0, and the next match takes the first-cap path at 0x76b890 (test al, al / jne 0x76b8c8): a
 * second "first cap" history row (call 0x86cc50) and the nation of that match made his first nation again.
 *
 * Here the byte stops at 255, and the runtime keeps the full count of each player above 255, by staff id (staff +0).
 * Every reader of the byte in the game then sees 255, the most it can hold, and the screens that show caps read the
 * full count. Older builds that load the save see 255. The counts go into the season part of the save (version 3,
 * season.c and season_change.c). Below 255 nothing changes: the store is empty and the game is the original's.
 * With the test switch RECOMP_SEASON_CODE=off no season part is written, so a save keeps only the byte 255. A count
 * left by a player whose id a new player takes (the byte then starts below 255) goes when that byte reaches 255. */
