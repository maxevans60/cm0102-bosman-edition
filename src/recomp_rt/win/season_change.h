/* The season change (0.6.0 slice 16; spec docs/specs/2026-10-16-seasons-0.6.0-spec.md, Q232, Q245, Q248, Q258).
 *
 * With changing rules on, each competition takes the rules of its new season at its season change, and the
 * player gets one news item for each season in which the rules change. With changing rules off, nothing
 * changes after the start (Q232). Research and evidence: docs/research/2026-10-17-season-change.md.
 *
 * When a season changes. The original has no single "new season" step. game_season_update_pass 0x5d5ae0 runs
 * at the end of every day. On the update day of a league table entry (+0x15, compared at 0x5d5bc8) it may move
 * the entry's season year (+0x35) and then calls start_new_season (vtable +0x8, at 0x5d5d1c) of each finished
 * competition of the entry. A top league also starts its lower leagues. The runtime wraps the pass and every
 * start_new_season (season_starts.c, made by tools/seasons/make_start_wraps.py). Hooks run only inside the
 * pass, only with changing rules on, and only for a season after the start year (the run from 1 January to
 * the start date at a new game, 0x5cc850, is not a change).
 *
 * The season S of a change comes from the game date: a change from January to September of year Y starts
 * season Y (2009 for 2009/10), a change from 1 October starts season Y + 1 (calendar-year leagues with update
 * days 27 November and 27 December start their next edition then; the rules table puts an edition in the row
 * of the year it is played).
 *
 * The season point of S is the first pass from 1 June to 30 September of year S in which an entry has its
 * update day (20 June in a game with England). The season hook runs there, and the news item of S is posted
 * there. A calendar-year league that changes before (January or February of S, or December of S - 1) gets its
 * rules on its own date; its sentences wait for the item of S. A sentence after the point goes into the item
 * of S that is already posted (the text is read when the item is shown).
 *
 * The registry. A rule kind is a table of functions; NULL leaves a hook out. Each later slice (17 to 29) adds
 * its kinds to the list season_rule_kinds in season_change.c, one line each. The hooks, in the order they run:
 *   new_game(Y)   after a new game is made in start year Y (any changing rules; after the start season hooks
 *                 of the run to the start date, see "The start season"). Example: build a kind's own
 *                 state for the game, such as the season of each rule it has applied.
 *   loaded(Y)     after a saved game is loaded. Example: rebuild that state from the game's memory.
 *   season(S)     once at the season point of S. Example: transfer windows of the new season.
 *   entry(c)      once per league table entry on its update day, before its first competition starts
 *                 (c->comp is 0). Scope by nation with c->nation, by entry with c->entry. The pass checks
 *                 the nation's selected flag (+0x11c, 0x5d5be5) only for the step of the entry's season year,
 *                 so this hook runs for an entry of a nation that is not selected too: a kind that adds a
 *                 competition checks that flag itself. Example: a
 *                 competition that starts in season S gets its object with season_change_add_comp.
 *   before(c)     before the start_new_season of a competition (c->started is 1). The original's own
 *                 set_up_rules (vtable +0x8c) and create_fixtures (League::create_fixtures 0x6835c0) run
 *                 inside start_new_season after it, so fields they set are overwritten. Example: a club count
 *                 that set_up_rules reads.
 *   after(c)      after the start_new_season of a competition (c->started 1), and on the update day for each
 *                 competition of the entry that did not start (c->started 0: an unfinished competition, or an
 *                 international one that waits for its next edition, such as the 2010 qualifiers on 25 July
 *                 2009). Example: the name of the season (season_kind_names.c).
 *
 * The base game. No kind is called at all (no hook of any kind) in the base game, a game that starts in 2001
 * with changing rules off, and with the test switch RECOMP_SEASON_CODE=off. So the base game and its saves stay
 * as they are (Q152, Q342), whatever a kind does.
 *
 * The start season. A game that starts after 2001 runs the entry, before, after and season hooks for its start
 * season too (S equal to the start year, c->start 1, season_change_is_start() 1), with changing rules on or off.
 * A game that starts in 2001 does not: the 2001/02 rules are the original's. Each league table entry gets the
 * hooks of the start season once:
 *   - an entry with its update day from 1 January to the start date (entries 5, 4, 11, 22, 2, 14, 3 and others):
 *     in the run to the start date of a new game (game_run_to_start_date 0x5cc850, called from create_game
 *     0x828110 at 0x829fd9; c->creating 1), before the first fixtures of the game are made;
 *   - an entry with its update day after the start date and before 1 October (entries 7 on 21 July, 0 on 25 July,
 *     8 on 31 July, 1 on 15 August, 6 on 28 August and others): on that day in the game (c->creating 0);
 *   - an entry with its update day from 1 October (entries 24 on 27 November, 15 on 27 December and others): its
 *     start season began in the year before the start year, before the game. At the end of the new game, its
 *     entry hook and the after hook of each of its competitions run (c->started 0, c->creating 1); there is no
 *     start_new_season, so no before hook. A kind that changes fixtures fixes the ones that are made.
 * So a kind applies the rules of the start season, for example 5 substitutes in a 2010/11 game. The start season
 * gives no news: season_change_news does nothing in its hooks. A later season (S after the start year) runs the
 * hooks only with changing rules on. The hooks of the start season also run after a load in the start year (the
 * in-game days above), so a kind writes only a real change, as for every season.
 *
 * A kind applies the rule of season S from its own table (the rules table, season_rules.h, or another). It
 * writes the game's memory only for a real change, so a season with no rule change leaves the game as it is.
 * For each change the player sees, it calls season_change_news with one sentence. After the last row of a
 * table the rule stays (Q248): a kind that finds no row changes nothing. */

 * holds the address of its record at +4. name is the new long name in the game's code (Windows-1252: call
