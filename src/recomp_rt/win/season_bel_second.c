/* Belgium: U23 sides stay below their first team and out of the top tier (open item 115, 0.7.0), and from 2015/16
 * the Second Division's 16th goes down directly (open item 124).
 *
 * The real rule (Wikipedia season pages of the Challenger Pro League 2020/21 to 2025/26 and the Belgian Competition
 * Authority, press release 19/2026, all read 3 November 2026; no federation text was found):
 * - from 2020/21 a U23 side never goes up to the top tier, and its promotion or play-off place goes to the next
 *   eligible club (2024/25: Club NXT 6th, Lokeren-Temse 7th took the play-off place);
 * - a U23 side always plays at least one level below its first team, in every tier;
 * - when its first team goes down from the Pro League, the U23 side goes down "whatever its place", and from
 *   2024/25 it "would automatically take up one of the relegation spots";
 * - the relegation shield: 2020/21 Club NXT was "not eligible for promotion or relegation", and no club went down
 *   at all, as National Division 1 was cancelled (the game keeps its relegation and uses the way of 2024/25 below
 *   for a U23 side only; 2021/22 had no U23 side in the division); 2024/25 no U23 side went down by the
 *   table and no club went down in its place (Jong Genk 15th and Seraing 14th stayed up, only Deinze went down,
 *   the third tier sent its two clubs up, so the division grew from 16 to 17); 2025/26 the Belgian Competition
 *   Authority abolished the shield in May 2026 (Club NXT stayed up only as RWDM lost its licence), so no shield
 *   from 2025/26 (Max, 4 November 2026: "copy real life");
 * - 2001/02 to 2019/20: no source has a U23 side in a national division, so those seasons keep the game.
 * Open item 124 (lead decision, 3 November 2026, "as in real life"): from 2015/16 no second-tier club played the
 * third tier's promotion play-off (sources: run-logs/0.6.2-s113/research-belgian-third-playoff.tsv).
 *
 * The original. BelFirst::start_new_season 0x41ea90 calls the chain BelFirst::process_promotion_relegation_chain
 * 0x41ee80 (vtable +0xb0 of BelFirst 0x967940). It records the last places of the four tables (vtable +0xa4,
 * 0x68aa30, which writes club +0x5b and +0x5f only) and calls league_promote_and_relegate 0x689c80 three times, in
 * pairs: First and Second (0x41ef03), Second and Third group A (0x41ef2b), Second and Third group B (0x41ef58). It
 * moves the rows of status 3 of the upper table down and the rows of status 0 or 5 of the lower table up. Then
 * bel_first_move_third_division_clubs 0x41ec90 sends the rows of status 3 of the two Third groups to Fourth A and B
 * (0x41ed1a..0x41ed76) and brings up the play-off winners and the four clubs that BelThird::create_relegation_
 * playoff_stage 0x423ba0 stored at +0xee..+0xfa. League::update_positions_and_status 0x684cd0 gives no title,
 * promotion or play-off to a row of status 0xfc (the original's mark for a German B side, 0x5dd942), so the next
 * row takes the place; in the zone of relegation such a row gets 3 (see season_nor_second.c). BelSecond::
 * update_positions_and_status 0x420680 (vtable +0x94 of 0x9679f4) calls 0x684cd0 and then gives status 1 to the
 * winner of each period only when its row has 0xff (0x42070e). BelSecond::create_playoff_group 0x420230 tops the
 * play-off group up to four with the rows of 0xff from the top (0x42028e..0x4202a6). BelThird::update_positions_
 * and_status 0x422f70 (vtable +0x94 of 0x967b48) does the same for groups A (this) and B (stage 0, this +0xc). The
 * original links no Belgian U23 side to its club (club_get_linked_b_team 0x540a50 holds Spain, Germany and
 * Portugal only).
 *
 * The fix (season games only, season_game_changes, from the season 2020/21):
 * - The link: a Belgian club whose name is a reserve name (season_clubs_reserve_name: a last word B, II, 2,
 *   Reserve(s), a word U21 or U23, Jong at the start) or ends in " 16 FC" (Standard de Liège 16 FC), less the
 *   first teams "Jong Westel". Its first team is the Belgian club of the name without that word, or the name of a
 *   small exception table (RSC Charleroi B, Zulte-Waregem B, Beerschot V.A U23, Standard de Liège 16 FC).
 * - In the season: before 0x420680 every U23 side of the Second Division gets 0xfc; before 0x422f70 each U23 side
 *   of the Third Division whose first team plays in the Second Division or lower next season (its level now, moved
 *   by its status once its table sets one) gets 0xfc, and gets 0xff back when that no longer holds. So the next
 *   clubs take the title, the promotion places, the periods and the play-offs. A row that already holds such a
 *   place (a save of an older build made after the table was complete) hands it to the best placed row of 0xff
 *   (hand_on); the play-off builders 0x420230 and 0x423880 do the same first.
 * - The Fourth Division list: for the call of 0x423ba0 a U23 side of the four Fourth Divisions whose first team
 *   plays in the Third Division or lower next season reads as no division, so it is no part of the four that go up
 *   or of the relegation play-off (the original's own way for Spain, 0x8504c9..0x8504ec; see season_nor_second.c).
 * - At the season change, before 0x41ee80, in this order: (1) a U23 side in the First Division (an old save) gets
 *   3 and the best placed club of 3 there stays up (0xff), as the moves go in pairs; (2) a U23 side of the Third
 *   Division that goes up (0 or 5) to the division of its first team next season hands the place to the best
 *   placed row of 0xff of its group; (3) the shield (2020/21 and 2024/25): a U23 side of the Second Division with 3
 *   by the table gets 0xff and no club goes down in its place; the division holds 18 in the game (0x41fd82) and
 *   0x689c80 moves in pairs, so one promotion of the Third Division drops (the promotion play-off's winner, else
 *   the group winner with the fewest points, gets 0xfe); a U23 side whose first team goes down is no part of the
 *   shield, it goes down by step 4; (4) a U23 side of the Second Division whose first team plays there or lower next
 *   season (its first team relegated from the First Division, or an old save) gets 3 and the best placed club of 3
 *   stays up; (5) a U23 side of the Third Division whose first team plays in the Third Division or lower next season
 *   gets 3 and the best placed club of 3 of its group stays up. A U23 side with more such sides than clubs of 3
 *   stays one more season (logged). A U23 side sent down from the First Division whose first team plays in the
 *   Second Division shares its division for one season, until step 4 of the next change.
 * - Open item 124, from 2015/16: for the call of BelThird::create_promotion_playoff_stage 0x423880 the row 15 that
 *   it reads (+0x375, 0x423a80) holds the next club of the Third Division (the best placed row of 0xff that the
 *   original does not put in, the more points of the two groups, group A on a tie), and the Second Division's 16th
 *   gets 3. Its place is that of the relegation play-off: status 2, or 0xfc for a U23 side (another status is a
 *   fault: logged, and the original plays). The results go through BelThird::update_staff_records_for_status
 *   0x4230d0, which gives a club of this division 0 when it wins (0x4231b2) and 0xfe when it loses (0x423204).
 * Accepted effects: a club that stays up or takes a place keeps the news of its earlier status, and the 16th gets
 * no news of its direct relegation (0x684cd0 and 0x4230d0 send them through vtable +0x40 when they set a status).
 * The Third Division club whose promotion the shield drops keeps the news of its promotion; a group winner (5)
 * drops only when no play-off winner (0) is left, and stays champion in the table.
 * Not built (no rule text or no way in the game): the quota of four U23 sides (2025/26) and the 2026/27
 * replacement rule, the one-division third tier of 2016/17 on (the game keeps two groups), the 2015/16 reform year
 * (nine clubs down) and the real sizes of the Second Division (16, 17 in 2025/26, 15 in 2026/27: the game holds 18).
 *
 * Test switches: RECOMP_BEL_SECOND=off plays as the original (the log still works). RECOMP_BEL_SECOND_LOG=1 logs
 * the marks, the moves, the play-off and a census of the U23 sides at each season change. Tests only:
 * RECOMP_TEST_BEL_POINTS=<name>=<+|->;... moves the named clubs to the top (+) or the bottom (-) of their table by
 * points (+0x19) before each update of the Second and Third Divisions; RECOMP_TEST_BEL_DOWN=<name>;... gives the
 * named clubs of the First Division 3 before the chain (and the best placed club of 3 0xff), as a relegated first
 * team; RECOMP_TEST_BEL_SECOND_OLD=<n> plays as the original until n Belgian season changes are done. */

 * the top) gives the free promotion
 * play-off place to the next club. A game with the rules off (or RECOMP_BEL_SECOND=off) keeps the original. Each
 * change logs one line. Ties: BelThird gives tied rows their own places (2067 and 2070 dumps: equal points at
 * places 13, 14 and 15), so each place holds one row. The
