/* A match moved for a call-up stays before its competition's season change (O288: the Danish Superliga stalled one
 * season).
 *
 * The season change pass game_season_update_pass 0x5d5ae0 starts the competitions of a league table entry only on
 * the entry's update day (entry +0x15, the day of the year, compared with the game day at 0x5d5bc8; Denmark: day
 * 170), and only a competition that is ready then (vtable +0xc at 0x5d5ccb; a league is ready when every row has
 * played its matches, League::check_complete 0x689ad0, 0x689b3d..0x689b58). A competition that is not ready waits for
 * the update day of the next year, and so runs one season late from then on.
 *
 * NationalTeams::reschedule_clashing_club_fixtures 0x7777e0 calls FIXTURE_MANAGER::reschedule_club_fixtures_near_date
 * 0x5abb10 (0x77795c) for a club whose players are called up. For each fixture of the club near the date it calls
 * remove_fixture 0x5abc30, find_new_fixture_date 0x5ab510 (0x5abbd2), add_fixture 0x5aa680 with flag 1 (0x5abbdc) and
 * queue_fixture_moved_news 0x5aac70 (0x5abbeb). 0x5ab510 (thiscall (fixture) ret 4; year at fixture +0x28, day at
 * +0x2a, slice at +0x3f) looks for a free weekday up to about 20 days after the old date, else takes today + 2, with
 * no look at the season's end. In the base game the leagues end in May, well before their update days. A season game
 * has international windows in June each year (the Nations League and the qualifiers of slices 23, 28 and 29): in a
 * 2021 Select All game FC Copenhagen's last Superliga match of 2022/23 was moved on days 148, 152, 155 and 156 and
 * came after day 170, so the Superliga was not complete on its update day and started 2023/24 a year late (gate (a)
 * run 7; Denmark alone has too few call-ups to show it).
 *
 * So in a season game, only for the call of 0x5abbd2: when the new date of 0x5ab510 is on or after the competition's
 * next update day, the match goes to the last free day before that update day (no clash at all in
 * find_fixture_clashes 0x5ad780, with the slice of get_time_slice 0x5af2f0, as 0x5ab510 and add_fixture test a day),
 * and after the old date and today. When there is no free day and the old date is after today, the match keeps its
 * old date and slice: the leg check record that 0x5ab510 added (list 0xae2a48, round variants 3 and 4) is removed,
 * add_fixture inserts it without its clash moves (flag 0 with the try count 0xae2a40 at 10, as add_fixture does
 * after its tenth try), and no "fixture moved" news is queued. The club plays without its called-up players, as a
 * league plays at the end of its season. When the old date is today or past, the new date of 0x5ab510 stays.
 * The other 11 calls of 0x5ab510, the base game and RECOMP_SEASON_CODE=off keep the original (Q152). */
