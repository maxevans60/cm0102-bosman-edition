/* A match moved for a call-up stays before its competition's season change (O288: the Danish Superliga stalled one
 * season).
 *
 * The season change pass game_season_update_pass 0x5d5ae0 starts the competitions of a league table entry only on
 * the entry's update day (entry +0x15, the day of the year, compared with the game day at 0x5d5bc8; Denmark: day
 * 170), and only a competition that is ready then (vtable +0xc at 0x5d5ccb; a league is ready when every row has
 * played its matches, League::check_complete 0x689ad0, 0x689b3d..0x689b58). A competition that is not ready waits for
 * the update day of the next year, and so runs one season late from then on.
 *
 * NationalTeams::reschedule_clashing_club_fixtures 0x7777e0 calls FIXTURE_MANAGER::reschedule_club_fixtures_near_date
 * 0x5abb10 (0x77795c) for a club whose players are called up. For each fixture of the club near the date it calls
 * remove_fixture 0x5abc30, find_new_fixture_date 0x5ab510 (0x5abbd2), add_fixture 0x5aa680 with flag 1 (0x5abbdc) and
 * queue_fixture_moved_news 0x5aac70 (0x5abbeb). 0x5ab510 (thiscall (fixture) ret 4; year at fixture +0x28, day at
 * +0x2a, slice at +0x3f) looks for a free weekday up to about 20 days after the old date, else takes today + 2, with
 * no look at the season's end. In the base game the leagues end in May, well before their update days. A season game
 * has international windows in June each year (the Nations League and the qualifiers of slices 23, 28 and 29): in a
 * 2021 Select All game FC Copenhagen's last Superliga match of 2022/23 was moved on days 148, 152, 155 and 156 and
 * came after day 170, so the Superliga was not complete on its update day and started 2023/24 a year late (gate (a)
 * run 7; Denmark alone has too few call-ups to show it).
 *
 * The clash code moves matches too (den-stall-2, run 8, 2021 start, 2022/23): a call-up move put Randers FC v FC
 * Copenhagen on day 169 of 2023, the add_fixture that followed (flag 1, 0x5abbdc) found a clash and moved it with its
 * own call of 0x5ab510 (0x5aa96e) to day 171, and the Superliga missed its update day of 170 again. So the rule
 * covers the moves of 0x5ab510 that take a match away from a clash or a call-up, each with the add_fixture (flag 0)
 * and the news that follow it (SITES): the call-up move 0x5abbd2, add_fixture's move of the new fixture 0x5aa96e and
 * of a weaker stored one 0x5aaa25, and resolve_same_day_clash 0x5ae55c, 0x5ae5d8. The other calls (a date today or
 * past at 0x5aa729, an abandoned match 0x6b6084, the cup and manager calls) keep the original.
 *
 * So in a season game, for those calls: when the new date of 0x5ab510 is on or after the competition's
 * next update day, the match goes to the last free day before that update day, after the old date and not before
 * today + 2 (0x5ab929..0x5ab935). A day is free by 0x5ab510's own test (0x5ab9b6..0x5ab9f2): with the slice of
 * get_time_slice 0x5af2f0, find_fixture_clashes 0x5ad780 gives no clash, or the severity 1, or a severity below the
 * match's priority (+0x3a). An international window of the club fails it (severity 0x15, 0x776fc0). When the update
 * day is in the next year, the search goes on into the rest of the old date's year. When there is no free day and the old date is after today, the match keeps its
 * old date and slice: the leg check record that 0x5ab510 added (list 0xae2a48, round variants 3 and 4) is removed,
 * add_fixture inserts it without its clash moves (flag 0 with the try count 0xae2a40 at 10, as add_fixture does
 * after its tenth try), and no "fixture moved" news is queued. The club plays without its called-up players, as a
 * league plays at the end of its season. When the old date is today or past, the new date of 0x5ab510 stays.
 * A kept date keeps its clash, and that is harmless (the maintainer check, 27 October 2026). In a 2007 start (Select All,
 * November 2007, leg 2008/09) four Primera División (Spain) matches of the last round sat on 18 June 2009 (day 169;
 * update day 170): Sevilla v Atlético de Madrid, Barcelona v Cádiz, Real Madrid v Celta, Valencia v Murcia. Spain
 * played the Confederations Cup on days 166, 168 and 171. On the clash with Spain v South Africa (day 168, severity
 * 10 against priority 2) add_fixture moved each to day 171, so the rule kept day 169: no day lies between the old date
 * and the update day. All four matches and Spain's three matches were played, the clubs without their players on
 * duty for Spain (the team pick leaves out players on duty, get_international_duty_club 0x7757d0; the duty window of
 * a finals squad runs from 10 days before its first match, select_squad 0x76c120, so from day 156 no day would have
 * had them). The rule moves no match before its old date, as 0x5ab510 does not. No box and no forfeit: the Primera División was complete on
 * day 170 and started 2009/10 on time (exact replay, run-logs/hold-primera).
 * A cup tie has a second bound: its next round's match day (jap-cup-stall, gate (b) 2006 on ec579543). The Emperor's
 * Cup plays its rounds a week apart in December and its final on 2 January, with Japan's update day 24. In 2009 the
 * round 3 tie Yokohama F Marinos v Jubilo Iwata (day 346) was moved by clashes on days 340, 343 and 346 to days 349,
 * 356 and 363, past round 4's day 353. Each later tie of its winner was made after its own date, and add_fixture's
 * move of a past date (0x5aa729) keeps the weekday, so each round went a week on: the final came on day 26 of 2010,
 * the cup was not complete on day 24 and held edition 2009 for a year. So a covered move of a cup tie takes the last
 * free day before the next round's match day (the same search), when that day comes before the update day bound.
 * When no day is free, the move of 0x5ab510 stays (logged). The tie is found by its two clubs in a drawn tie of the
 * cup's round table (next_round_day). The bound covers one more call for cup ties only: add_fixture's move of a
 * fixture dated before today (0x5aa729). With the first fix the replay still had two round 5 ties of the Club World
 * Cup clubs made after their day 356, moved to day 363, past round 6 on day 360 (final on day 12 of 2010). Other
 * fixtures keep that call's original move.
 * The two legs of a tie stay in order (item 90). In a 2006 game (run set pass 2, a2006s2, day 169 of 2055) the
 * Segunda División play-off final was drawn on day 162 with its first leg on day 165 and its second on day 169, the day
 * before the league's update day 170. Cup::create_tie_fixtures adds the first leg, then the second. The first met a
 * clash, and the rule put it on day 169, the last free day before day 170, while the second leg was not yet stored; the
 * second, added next, met a clash too and the rule kept its old day 169. With both legs on one day Cup::process_fixture
 * took one as the first leg (its leg count, tie +0x32 plus +0x33, 0x51a3ce..0x51a3e5), found no second leg from the next
 * day (find_next_fixture 0x5ac920 at 0x51a610) and stopped at the box "Cup..cpp 1278" (0x51a672). Whether the box comes
 * depends on the order of the day's matches; the same save played as a normal game puts both legs on day 169 too. So
 * for a leg (the round code's digit 3 or 4, comp_util_get_round_variant 0x4b0850): a first leg's move is bounded by
 * its second leg when that is stored, and a second leg never keeps a day on or before its first leg; it then takes the
 * move of 0x5ab510, which lies after its old date, as the original would. The legs are found as process_fixture finds a
 * second leg (other_leg). A leg's past-date move (0x5aa729) is covered too.
 * The other 7 calls of 0x5ab510, the base game and RECOMP_SEASON_CODE=off keep the original (Q152).
 *
 * Test switch RECOMP_TEST_FIXTURE_HOLD (season games only): "log" prints each covered move; "1" also takes the new
 * date of each covered move later in the same year as the update day, so that the free day search and the kept date
 * act on every such move (forced case of the retest). */

/* A match that a shared stadium moves to another weekday keeps that day when only weaker matches clash there
 * (item 218). find_fixture_clashes 0x5ad780 gives severity 20 when two clubs that share a stadium play at home on one
 * day, and add_fixture 0x5aa680 then calls resolve_same_day_clash 0x5ae380 (0x5aa8c5). That function moves the
 * weaker club's match to another weekday of the same week (0x5ae43d..0x5ae47b: Wednesday to Tuesday), then checks
 * the new day (0x5ad780 at 0x5ae52e, 0x5ae5ab) and, on any clash, moves the match again with find_new_fixture_date
 * 0x5ab510 (0x5ae55c, 0x5ae5d8). It does not compare the clash with the match's priority, as add_fixture does
 * (0x5aa939: the new match moves only when the top severity is at least its priority +0x3a, else the weaker stored
 * match moves, 0x5aaa25). In a 2025 start (run set pass 5, a2025s1, leg 1) the league phase draw put AC Milan v
 * VfL Wolfsburg and Internazionale v 1.FC Heidenheim 1846 on 7 September 2039 (day 249). Milan v Wolfsburg went to
 * Tuesday 6 September, met Hoffenheim v Wolfsburg (Bundesliga, priority 2) the next day, and 0x5ab510 took it to
 * 31 August (day 242), the day before UEFA's second registration (process_euro_registration 0x85a9b0, 1 September).
 * Wolfsburg had registered no player, the eligibility check gave code 8 to 41 of 50 (0x5832e0, 0x5833e1), and the
 * match stopped at "match_eng..cpp 652" (init_match 0x6b8aca) with 9 players.
 * So at those two calls, when the top severity of the new day (the caller's [esp+0x10]) is below the match's
 * priority, the match stays on its new day; add_fixture (0x5ae56a, 0x5ae5e6) then inserts it and deals with each
 * listed match by its own rule (the loop from 0x5aa9b4): a friendly is cancelled (0x5c6570), a priority 9 match
 * removed (0x5aa9e0), any other moved (0x5aaa25). The match keeps the original's move when add_fixture would not
 * insert it: a match of the six minor competitions of 0x7e6f20 (add_fixture returns 0 at 0x5aa9f8 on a stored clash,
 * and 0x5ae380 drops its result, so the copy on its stack would be lost), a priority 9 match (the check at
 * 0x5aa8ee..0x5aa92c may drop it), or a try count 0xae2a40 at 10 (add_fixture skips its clash code, 0x5aa882, and
 * the clash would stay). It keeps the move too when the new day is before today + 2 (0x5ab510's own bound,
 * 0x5ab92d), and, for a day after the old one, when the match is a leg (item 90) or the day reaches the
 * competition's update day (the season-end rule above). Both clashing matches were on the old day, so the old day
 * is that of the match add_fixture was given (0x5ae380's first argument, the caller's [esp+0x2e4]). Real life: UEFA
 * solves league phase stadium and city clashes in the match calendar, within the competition's match week, Tuesday
 * and Wednesday for the Champions League (Principles set by the UEFA Club Competitions Committee for the 2025/26

 * add (0x5aab27, the new fixture's year in memory) moved the first leg a day earlier, to day 197. The nearby move of
 * that add found Scottish League Cup 2771 v 6416 on day 195, today, two days before, and moved it to day 194: its
 * remove (0x5aec0e) freed the store's copy of today's match, and its add met a date before today (0x5aa729), went to
 * day 200 and moved the stored second leg (0x5aaa25) to day 198. The store gave the second leg the freed block. The
 * day's match code still held the old block and wrote today's match back into it (a trace showed the second leg's
 * block holding the League Cup match of day 195 before the friendlies of the day were added), so the second leg left
 * the store. On day 197 Cup::process_fixture found no second leg after the first (find_next_fixture 0x5ac920 at
 * 0x51a610) and stopped at the box "Cup..cpp 1278" (0x51a672). The original moves only by a day and checks clashes
 * (0x5ad780), not the date against today. So when the old date or the new date is today or before, the remove, the
 * add and the news of that move are skipped (both branches: 0x5aec0e, 0x5aec1c, 0x5aec32 and 0x5aedc8, 0x5aedd6,
 * 0x5aedec), and the match stays where it is. */
