/* The youth pool of every nation (0.6.2 slice 20, open item 52). This fixes a fault of the original that every
 * game reaches, the base 2001 game included.
 *
 * A player who retires gives his player data and his nation to the pool of PLAYER_REGEN. process_retirements
 * 0x7a59e0 does this with add_player_data_to_pool 0x7a8350 at 0x7a6463, or with queue_staff_for_regen 0x7a87d0.
 * The second also queues the staff slot. process_regen_queue 0x7a65d0 makes one new player for each due slot with
 * regenerate_as_youth_player 0x7abac0. That function takes the nation of the first pool entry (this +0x3c, entry
 * +4, read at 0x7abb13). So each nation gets back about as many new players as it loses.
 *
 * The age of the new player comes from his nation (0x7abe87..0x7abeee). Some nations are not loaded (league flags
 * +0x11c are 0) and had 349 players or fewer at the start (+0x88 below 0x15e). For them the age is 23 to 27 when
 * rand(+0x88) < rand(1000), else 17 to 23. Nation +0x88 is the number of staff with player data of the nation.
 * database_trim_staff_tables 0x524d70 counts it once, and no code changes it later. Any other nation gets 15 to
 * 20 in nearly all cases (0x7ac3dd). The birth year at staff +0x12 is the game year less the age.
 *
 * So nearly every new player of a small nation that is not loaded is 23 or older. The young players of the data
 * grow up and none follow. In a 2001 game with England only, Croatia, Nigeria and Norway have no player under 21
 * by July 2004. By 2007, 13 nations with 23 players or more have none (0.6.0 long game, seed 5). The forum save of
 * January 2041 (Greece only) has 24 such nations, Belgium among them. Their under-21 and Olympic squads are empty.
 *
 * The fix has two parts. Both keep the code of the original while every nation has its youth pool.
 *
 * 1. Young ages. The pool nation of a new player can have the older ages, 23 players or more, and fewer than 1 in
 *    20 of them under 21 or fewer than 1 in 10 under 23 (youth_pool_short). Part 2 below says when a nation runs
 *    out. For a short nation or one that runs out, the wrap of 0x7abac0 sets the nation's +0x88 to 0x15e for the
 *    call and puts the old value back after it. Only this function reads +0x88
 *    (0x7abcd7, 0x7abd15, 0x7abea0), and no save runs in the call. With 0x15e the nation keeps the new player,
 *    because the change of nation at 0x7abcd7 needs fewer than 100. He gets the young ages of 0x7ac3dd.
 * 2. A new player for a nation that runs out. A nation gets new players only when its own players retire. A young
 *    new player plays longer, so fewer of them come. A nation of 23 to 30 players can still reach none under 21
 *    for a while. In a model of 40 such nations over 300 years, part 1 alone leaves 2 % of the decade checks
 *    with an empty nation. So the wrap looks for a nation with a continent and 23 players or more that will have
 *    none under 21 or none under 23 in a year. That is none under 20 or none under 22 today (youth_pool_runs_out).
 *    When the pool nation is not short and does not run out, the new player goes to that nation with the young
 *    ages. A loaded nation in need keeps its new players, which have the young ages already. The wrap writes
 *    that nation into the pool entry (+4) for the call, and 0 as the second nation (+8). A second nation of 0 is
 *    none (0x7abd22). The original removes the entry in the call (0x7abb1a). When it returns before that
 *    (0x7abae6, 0x7abaf1), the wrap puts the entry back. With both parts the model has no empty nation in any
 *    decade. A nation of under 30 players grows by at most 35 in 300 years (tests/seasons/test_youth_pool.c).
 *
 * A game changes from the first new player of a nation that is short or runs out. At the start of a 2001 game no
 * nation is either. The start, prematch and all-leagues fixtures have no nation of 23 players or more that is
 * short or has none under 20 or none under 22. The lowest shares are 6 % under 21 and 13 % under 23. In an
 * England-only 2001 game seven nations are short by July 2004. A 2025 start has nations that are short or run out
 * in its first two years (Angola and Algeria short, Belarus out of players under 20, July 2027).
 *
 * The counts come from one pass over the staff table at the first new player of each call of 0x7a65d0. Then each
 * new player changes the counts of his slot. A queued slot keeps its old player data until the new player takes
 * it. The wrap takes the old player out of the counts before it decides. */
