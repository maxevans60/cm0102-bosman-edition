/* Every African nation in CAF World Cup qualifying (item 199 of 0.6.2). Changing rules on only (season_intl_on)
 * and campaigns for the World Cup of 2006 or later: the base game, a game with changing rules off and the campaign
 * of 2002 that a 2001/02 game starts in do not change (Q152).
 *
 * Real life (en.wikipedia.org "<year> FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)", read 9 November 2026): every CAF member
 * that enters plays, with a two-leg first round of the weakest. 2006: 51 entered, 42 in the first round (21 ties),
 * 9 byes, then 5 groups of 6. 2010: 10 in the first round, then 12 groups of 4 and 5 groups of 4. 2014: 52
 * entered, 24 in the first round, then 10 groups of 4 and 5 ties. 2018: 54 entered, 26 in the first round, 20
 * ties, then 5 groups of 4. 2022: 54 entered, 28 in the first round, then 10 groups of 4 and 5 ties. 2026: 54
 * entered (cafonline.com), 9 groups of 6. Somalia played the first round of 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022. The
 * game keeps its own shape (a first round, then groups whose winners qualify), so only the entrants follow real
 * life: every African nation of the database, less the hosts.
 *
 * The original (wc_african_cup, class WcAfricanCup, vtable 0x970ad0). The pool builder collect_entrants 0x9106a0
 * counts the African hosts of find_hosts and the holder into the exempt count +0xba, sets the pool size +0xb6 = 50
 * less +0xba (0x9107e8), allocates 52 slots for the pool +0xb2 (malloc 0xd0 at 0x9107ed) and fills them with the
 * African nations' teams in nation-table order, hosts and holder left out, until 52 (cmp ebx, 0x34 at 0x910896).
 * It sorts the count it found by reputation (0x4b07d0 at 0x9108fc); only the first +0xb6 play. So the nations
 * after the 52nd in the table never play, and of the 52 the two weakest are out: Somalia and Equatorial Guinea in
 * 53 of 55 cycles of the pass 4 game a2001to2300. The first round build_first_round_entries 0x910120 takes the
 * weakest +0x3e (50 with no exempt nation, 0x910133) of the first +0xb6 into two-leg ties and clears their slots.
 * The group builder create_group_stages 0x9109e0 puts the winners in the cleared slots, sorts the +0xb6 slots and
 * deals them into G groups of S, group g taking slots g, g + G, ... (0x910bba): 5 groups of 5 with no exempt nation
 * (0x910a45), 4 groups of 6 with one (0x910a6f). The groups play 10 matchdays unless they hold 4 teams
 * (create_round_table 0x90f600). save_extra_data 0x911110 writes +0xb6 and that many slots, and load_extra_data
 * 0x910f00 reads +0xb6 and then allocates 52 slots (0x910fec) for them.
 *
 * The change. The pool builder reads every nation of the table (the cap at 0x910896 becomes the nation count, the
 * array that count), and after the formats of slice 27 (season_intl_qual.c, F1) and slice 29 (season_wcq26.c) at
 * 0x9108d8, with no exempt nation left, the pool size +0xb6 becomes the plan's entrants (season_caf_plan): the
 * count found, at most two per group place. The first round takes 2 x (entrants - places).
 * - A World Cup of 48 teams (season_wcq26): 9 groups of 5 (8 in 2030), the first round of season_wcq26.c, which
 *   reads +0xb6. With 54 nations: 18 in the first round, 36 byes.
 * - Else the original's 5 groups. A pool of 50 or fewer keeps groups of 5 (50 nations: the original's round of
 *   50). A larger pool takes groups of 6 (30 places, 10 matchdays, as the original's groups with one exempt
 *   nation): 53 nations give 46 in the first round and 7 byes, as the 42 and 9 of 2006. The group builder's size
 *   comes from +0xb6 (above 50 with no exempt nation), so a loaded save gives the same groups.
 * Load allocates the larger of 52 slots and +0xb6, so a save of such a campaign loads; the base game's +0xb6 is
 * at most 50, so its load does not change.
 *
 * set_club_progress 0x9115a0 writes each team's group positions (+0x73, +0x74 and +0x75 of its Comp_Stats entry,
 * from 0x4a4850) as a band of the whole field: with no exempt nation, group position p of stages 0 to 4 becomes
 * 5 x (p - 1) + 1 (the jump tables at 0x911a78, 0x911a8c and 0x911aa0: 1, 6, 11, 16, 21), and a position the
 * tables do not hold is written as it is (0x911600, 0x911631, 0x911a64). With one exempt nation (4 groups of 6)
 * position 6 has its band, 21 (0x911707). So in a group of 6 the last team got 6, a runner-up's band. In the old
 * shape with groups of 6, position 6 gets 5 x 5 + 1 = 26. */
