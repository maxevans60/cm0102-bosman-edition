/* The injury records at a new game (0.6.0 slice 15). This fixes a bug of the original that a season game can
 * reach.
 *
 * Injury::init_records 0x62cf70 runs once at a new game (Injury::Injury 0x62a680 calls it at 0x62a873). It
 * allocates one 31-byte record per staff (malloc at 0x62cf91, count [0xae2364]). It fills the records in the
 * order of the staff table: at 0x62d036..0x62d056 record i gets its values (+0xe, +0x14 and +0x18 are -1).
 * In the same loop about one player in a hundred gets an injury or illness (Injury::add_injury 0x62d250,
 * called at 0x62d0df). An illness can spread: Injury::add_illness_outbreak 0x62e820 (called at 0x62dbfd)
 * calls add_injury at 0x62eb6e for other players. A player of a later staff row then has a record that the
 * loop has not filled yet. Its memory is fresh, so every field is 0.
 *
 * add_injury reads the current injury at +0xe (0x62d3f1). The value 0 is not -1. For an illness type (0x4d,
 * 0x4e, 0x4f, 0x51, tests at 0x62d3fa..0x62d40c) it writes that injury to the history file with
 * FILE_LLIST::add_node 0x58e340 and the offsets +0x14 and +0x18, both 0. With offsets that are not -1,
 * add_node opens the file "r+b" (0x58e5c1). The file does not exist yet, so the game stops at the box "Disk
 * Space Error" (file_llist.cpp 161, 0x58e601). For other types add_injury ends at 0x62dc82 and returns -1.
 * A start in 2009/10 with an older club moves table showed it: the illness of staff row 19736 reached row
 * 19744.
 *
 * The fix: while init_records runs, an add_injury call for a staff row after the row of the loop returns -1 at
 * once, as add_injury does at 0x62dc82. That player gets no injury, and the loop fills his record later as
 * before. So no injury of the injury list (this +4, written at 0x62d4bc) names a record that the loop then
 * clears. Only a season game has the fix: the base game keeps the code of the original. */
