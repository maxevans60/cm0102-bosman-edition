/* Network screens in widescreen mode (0.7.0 item 212). Every coordinate on the network is a classic one, as in the
 * original: a game in widescreen mode sends classic values and widens what it gets.
 *
 * The fault. display.c widens each area and widget from 800x600 to the screen when the game creates it (the wraps of
 * area create 0x55fba0 and widget create 0x55f990). The host builds a joiner's screen with the same functions, so
 * a host in widescreen mode stored and sent widened values, and the joiner widened them again when its packet applier
 * Display::process_command_packet 0x564080 created them (areas at 0x564c31, widgets at 0x565c11). A widescreen joiner
 * drew the screen 1.6 times too far right, a classic joiner drew 1280-wide values on 800x600. With a classic host
 * both worked, except the joiner's red title bar (widget changes on the joiner, below).
 *
 * Where coordinates cross the network, and the change at each (classic mode: every function here gives its value
 * back, ds_screen and ds_classic are the identity at 800x600):
 * - Areas. Area create 0x55fba0 writes each area into the command block at 0xae2908 (x1, y1, x2, y2 at 0x55fc29,
 *   0x55fcb7, 0x55fd45, 0x55fdd3, from its arguments, which display.c has widened) before it builds it (Area::init
 *   0x402ac0 at 0x560109). Display::send_screen_section 0x562370 copies that block into the joiner's packet
 *   (0x562464). tools/recomp/net_scale.py writes the classic values in the block (rt_net_classic_x/y).
 * - Widgets. send_screen_section sends the fields of each widget that differ from the copy it sent last
 *   (Guio::get_fields 0x5ee4a0 at 0x5628e8 on the widget, at 0x5629e0 on the copy; the copy is a raw copy of the
 *   host's widget table, 0x563c7e). Both calls give classic rectangles here (outputs 2 to 5: x1, y1, x2, y2 from the
 *   widget's +0x10..+0x1c).
 * - Widget moves. ScreenManager::set_widget_rect 0x800890 writes opcode 8 sub-op 1 with x1, y1, x2, y2 (0x800a9c,
 *   0x800b1d, 0x800b9e, 0x800c1f) and applies it through 0x564080 on this computer (0x800c5f, 0x800c8e) or sends it
 *   (0x800cb1). net_scale.py writes classic values, and the applier's sub-op 1 (0x567127: the four values at
 *   esp+0x28, +0x30, +0x38, +0x2c, then 0x567ac0) widens them before it uses them (0x567157), on the host and on the
 *   joiner alike.
 * - Clicks. A joiner's click (Display::send_widget_click 0x568560) sends all fields of the widget, the rectangle too
 *   (get_fields at 0x568713), and of a second widget when there is one (get_fields at 0x569226): a shirt dropped on
 *   the pitch of the tactics screen sends the pitch. The joiner sends classic values, and the host's opcode 6 case
 *   widens them when it builds the widgets again (Guio::init 0x5ee150 at 0x5669be and 0x566fab; x1, y1, x2, y2 are
 *   its arguments 4 to 7).
 * - Drags. Between the two widgets the click sends the Display's drag: the dragged widget (+0xba9dc) and where it was
 *   let go, x1, y1, x2, y2 at +0xba9be (0x569114..0x56918b). net_scale.py loads them as classic values
 *   (0x569146..0x56914e), and the host's opcode 6 case widens them where it stores them (0x566d33..0x566d42). The
 *   tactics input measures the drop from it and from the pitch (0x89f710: the drag at 0x8a2099, the target at
 *   0x8a20bb). Without it a widescreen joiner's drag on a classic host left the player where he was, and any joiner's
 *   drag on a widescreen host made him FL (run-logs/i212/drag-*).
 * - Widget changes on the joiner. Opcode 1 sends only the fields that changed. The joiner takes the others from its
 *   own widget ([0xae2918] + index * 0x18c, get_fields at 0x564ef8), whose rectangle it has widened, and builds the
 *   widget again with widget create (0x565c11), which widens it once more. That get_fields gives classic values too.
 *   Without it the red title bar, which stays from one screen to the next, was drawn 1.6 times too far right from the
 *   second screen on (run-logs/i212/combo-ww), with a classic host too. */
