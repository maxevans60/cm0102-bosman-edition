/* The reasons of network failures and their texts (0.7.0 slice 7, #45, docs/specs/2026-10-27-online-play-0.7.0-spec.md).
 *
 * Each failure that a player can meet in a network game has one reason here, and each reason has one text that
 * says what went wrong and what to do next. The texts go in the original's own boxes: "Unable To Join" and "Unable
 * To Create" (confirm_push 0x591840, from setup_create_or_join_network_game 0x8388e0 at 0x838a67), the game's
 * message box 0x5e8290 (net_session.c), and the Network tab of the Options box (options_screen.c). All texts that
 * players read in a network game live in net_errors.c, so that they can be read and checked in one place. */
