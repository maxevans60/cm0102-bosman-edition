 *
 * The Irish provincial cups.
 *
 * IreLeinsterCup::select_clubs 0x636a80 fills 16 places: four clubs drawn from the Leinster Senior League (the
 * division of [0x9cf854], 0x636b51; shuffle 0x4afbd0 at 0x636bdc, places 0 to 3 at 0x636bea..0x636c08), then the
 * clubs of the Premier and First Divisions ([0x9cf80c], [0x9cf810], 0x636b6d..0x636b77) whose stadium is in one of
 * seven towns (ire_club_is_in_leinster 0x6399c0: Dublin, Bray, Longford, Dundalk, Drogheda, Athlone, Kilkenny) into
 * places 4 to 15 (0x636b8c..0x636ba4). IreMunsterCup::collect_entrants 0x638e30 fills 20: sixteen drawn from the
 * Munster Senior League ([0x9cf850], 0x638f0b; 0x639081..0x6390b5) and four Premier or First Division clubs found by
 * name (Cork City, Cobh Ramblers, Waterford United, Limerick F.C., strings 0x9e9ff4..0x9e9fc0; places 16 to 19 at
 * 0x63902e..0x639046). The season databases from 2008/09 have fewer League of Ireland clubs in those seven towns and
 * other names for some of the four Munster clubs (Waterford FC, Limerick FC), or not the club at all, so places
 * stayed empty (gate (a) run 7: Leinster 1 or 2 of 16, Munster 1 or 2 of 20, ag-cup-fills.md).
 *
 * The real cups are open to the senior league clubs of the province, so after the class's pick an empty place takes
 * the next club of the cup's own provincial league that is not in the list, by reputation (+0x80): no random draw is
 * added, so the rest of the game is as before when no place is empty. Only in a season game (season_game_changes);
 * the base game's lists are full, so it is never reached there (Q152).
 *
 * Item 64 (0.6.2): every cup list of the original starts cleared in a season game (rt_cup_places_list below). */

 * The allocator 0x944e46 does not clear the block, and each class writes only the places it finds clubs for:
 * Leinster places 4 to 15 for the Premier and First Division clubs in its seven towns (0x636b9a), Munster places
 * 16 to 19 for the four clubs it finds by name (0x639038), the Polish top places for the clubs of the top division
 * (0x7c885b). Each start_new_season makes a new list, and the block is often the freed list of the last edition,
 * so a place the class did not write still held last edition's club. top_up took such a place as full: in a 2008
 * game (September 2008 database, gate (a) pre-run on 53fba30a) the 2009/10 Leinster Cup had place 15 empty and
 * top_up gave it Arklow Town; in 2010/11 the four senior league clubs drawn into places 0 to 3 held Arklow Town
 * again, place 15 still held it from the old block, so Arklow Town came in twice, a tie of round 2 lost its club
 * and Cup::process_fixture 0x51a150 stopped at Cup.cpp 1187 (find_tie 0x519c90 found no tie, 0x51a336). In a
 * season game the list now starts cleared. The base game writes every place, so it keeps the original's block
 * (Q152).
 *
 * Every other cup list of the original is made the same way (0.6.2 item 64), so every one starts cleared:
 * LIST_STORES of tools/recomp/league_sizes.py holds the 55 stores, and tests/seasons/cup_list_clear_check.py finds
 * them in the original and checks each size. CroCup::collect_entrants 0x517bb0 sets 48 places (0x517bc5), takes
 * the 0x120-byte list (0x517bcb, stored at 0x517bd5) and writes every club of the two Second Divisions
 * ([0x9cf8a8], [0x9cf8ac]; 0x517c68..0x517cdf), then every club of the First Division ([0x9cf8a4];
 * 0x517cff..0x517d4e). In a 2005 start with the 3.9.68 data the club moves leave 13 clubs in the First Division,
 * so the cup has 45 clubs and places 45 to 47 kept stale bytes: one pointed to a club of Brazil, so the cup
 * entrants fill (season_cup_entrants.c) took the list for a cup of several nations and left it. Cleared, the three
 * places read as empty and the cup entrants fill gives them Croatian clubs. The First Division loop writes no
 * round byte (+4, the Second Division loop draws it at 0x517c89..0x517ca7), so in a season game those places now
 * hold 0 there instead of stale bytes. */
