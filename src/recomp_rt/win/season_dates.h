/* Right ages and dates in every season (0.6.0 slice 11b, Q344).
 *
 * The Update Team databases expect the original start in 2001, so they store their dates early by some years.
 * When a new game starts in another season, the game adds the shift of each field to the years in memory.
 * The database files stay unchanged. A loaded save needs nothing: it holds the shifted data.
 *
 * The fields, their evidence, the measured shift of each database and the rules are in
 * docs/research/2026-10-17-season-date-shifts.md. The table is made by tools/seasons/make_dates_table.py from
 * docs/research/rules-0.6.0/databases-date-shifts*.tsv (tools/seasons/measure_date_shifts.py measures them).
 *
 * When it runs: right after the load of the database files (0x524d50, which calls the loader 0x528540 with the
 * file source), for the start year of that moment. The loader's own passes (the id pass 0x5315a0 and the staff
 * pass 0x52d20a with its 1998 compare at 0x52d2e1) work on the dates as the database stores them, as with a
 * 2001 start. Every change is kept in a journal. At the creation of the game (0x828110, from season.c) the
 * shift is made again when the start year is not the one of the load: the journal gives back the stored dates
 * first. The start screen keeps the data of a first start (0x81ce00 loads only when no nation is loaded), so a
 * second start in another season gets its shift there.
 *
 * It does nothing when the start year is 2001 (every database plays as it does today) and with the test
 * switch RECOMP_SEASON_CODE=off. */
