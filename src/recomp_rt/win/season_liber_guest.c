/* A Copa Libertadores winner from outside CONMEBOL (item 219, lead decision of 11 November 2026).
 *
 * The original's Libertadores has clubs of nations outside CONMEBOL: the Mexican guests. When one wins the final,
 * the original makes it CONMEBOL's side in three competitions:
 *   - the Intercontinental Cup: ConmebolLiber::update_staff_records_for_status 0x4c4080, for the winner of the
 *     final stage (stage 7, status 1, 0x4c4182), writes the winner (edi, the club argument, 0x4c418e) into the
 *     club list (+0xa7) of the Intercontinental Cup object ([0xadadfc] entry [0x9cf6e4], 0x4c41a0..0x4c41ab), into
 *     place 0 when the club there is South American (0x4c41b6..0x4c41cc), else into place 1 (0x4c41d0);
 *   - the Intercontinental Cup again: WorldClubCup::pick_qualifiers 0x92b8b0 (from the constructor 0x92b53e and
 *     start_new_season 0x92be50) writes place 0 of the latest Libertadores history row ([0x9cf63c], 0x4afd80 at
 *     0x92bb96 and 0x92bc81) into place 1 of the club list (+0xa7 + 6, 0x92bba4 and 0x92bc8f);
 *   - the FIFA Club World Championship: WorldClubChamp::pick_entrant 0x92ae60 takes for a continent place 0 of the
 *     latest history row of the continent's record (0x4afd80 at 0x92af59), and place 1 only when place 0 is
 *     already picked (0x92af7d); the record of South America is the Libertadores (season_kind_club_world.c);
 *   - our Recopa Sudamericana and FIFA Intercontinental Cup (season_club_cups.c, add_winner_of_year): the winner of
 *     the Libertadores history row.
 *
 * Real life: Mexican clubs played the Libertadores as guests in 1998 and from 2000 to 2016 and never won it. The
 * Intercontinental Cup was the match of the UEFA and the CONMEBOL champions, and the guests' entry rules gave the
 * Club World Cup and Recopa places to a CONMEBOL club. So a guest
 * that wins does not take CONMEBOL's place in any of the three: the best CONMEBOL club of that edition does, which
 * is the losing finalist. Each wrap below changes only the club that takes the place, at the point where the
 * original picks it. The guest keeps its title and its history row. Only with changing rules on (lead, 11 November
 * 2026): with them off the game keeps the original's choice, also in a season game of a later start. Each time the rule
 * acts, one log line names the cup, the guest and the club that takes its place. */
