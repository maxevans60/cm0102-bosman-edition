 * The table (season_uefa_table.c, made by tools/seasons/make_uefa_table.py from

 * Cup and of the Intertoto Cup. Slices 23 to 25 add their seasons as rows of the same table. The code reads a
 * format from the row; it does not test a year.
 *
 * The row of a season S for the game that runs (season_uefa_row): NULL for the base game (start year 2001,
 * changing rules off) and with RECOMP_SEASON_CODE=off, so the original runs as it is. With changing rules on,
 * the row of S; with changing rules off, the row of the start year (Q232). Before the first row the first row
 * applies, after the last row the last row (Q248). */
