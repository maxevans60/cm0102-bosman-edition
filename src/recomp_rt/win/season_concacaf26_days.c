/* The match days of the CONCACAF World Cup qualifying in the 2026 shape (0.6.2 item 214), season_concacaf26_days.h.
 *
 * Real life, 2026 cycle (en.wikipedia.org, "2026 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)", read 9 November 2026):
 * - first round: the four lowest-ranked teams in two ties, first legs 22 March 2024, second legs 26 March 2024;
 * - second round: six groups of five, single round robin, two home and two away, drawn on 25 January 2024, played
 *   in two windows, 5 to 11 June 2024 and 4 to 10 June 2025;
 * - third round: three groups of four, home and away, drawn on 12 June 2025, matchdays 4/5 and 8/9 September,
 *   9/10 and 13/14 October, 13 and 18 November 2025.
 * The game's League plays a group of 5 that meets once in 5 rounds (one side rests each round, League::create_fixtures
 * 0x6835c0 adds the resting place at 0x683c1b), so the second round takes 3 days in the June 2024 window and 2 in
 * the June 2025 window (inference: the page gives the windows only): 5, 8 and 11 June 2024, 6 and 10 June 2025, all
 * international match days of the FIFA days list. The third round takes the first day of each matchday. The first
 * round has no draw (the ties were set by the December 2023 FIFA ranking): its draw day is the second round's.
 *
 * The window rule (every cycle after 2026, an inference from the 2026 cycle). The FIFA days list has one window of
 * 6 days (Thursday to Tuesday) in March, June, September, October and November; a window here is a run of
 * consecutive FIFA days. With W the World Cup year:
 * - the draw on 25 January of W - 2;
 * - a pair of days of a window: its first day and the day 4 days later (Thursday and Monday, as the real days of
 *   22 and 26 March 2024 and 4 and 8 September 2025), or its last day when the window is shorter; a window of 6
 *   days holds two rounds at least 3 days apart (SEASON_STAGE_GAP), not three, and two windows one day apart (late
 *   September and early October) keep 3 days between their pairs;
 * - the first round on the pair of the March window of W - 2;
 * - the second round on the pair of the June window of W - 2, the first day of the March window of W - 1 and the
 *   pair of the June window of W - 1;
 * - the third round on the pairs of the first three windows from 1 September of W - 1. */
