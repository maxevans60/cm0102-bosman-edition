/* The screen sweep (0.6.0 slice 30a, check 4 of docs/research/brief-0.6.0/slice-30a.md). Test runs only: without
 * RECOMP_SCREEN_SWEEP=1 every function here returns at once and changes nothing.
 *
 * With RECOMP_SCREEN_SWEEP=1 the human turn (testrun.c) opens one competition screen a turn, as a click on a
 * competition name does (the news item click opens comp_screens_open_comp_screen 0x48f4a0 with (record, -2, -2,
 * 0), docs/research/2026-10-14-clickable-names-inventory.md), so the main loop builds and draws it like any screen
 * of the original. Each competition object (season_change_comps) gets five screens:
 *   - views 1 to 4 of the competition screen. 0x48f4a0 pushes the screen with build 0x48fcd0, input 0x4965d0 and
 *     leave 0x4985e0 (ScreenManager::open_screen 0x7fe600 at 0x48f500), then sets slot 0 to the record and slot 1
 *     to the view 1 (ScreenManager::set_screen_param 0x7ff270 at 0x48f517, 0x48f527). The sweep sets slot 1 again.
 *     The build draws the tab of the view through the jump table at 0x49134c (0x49072d..0x490737): view 1 the
 *     stages tab (league table 0x491380 for a League_Stage, else the cup rounds 0x492980, 0x490797..0x4907a8),
 *     2 the results, 3 the fixtures 0x493ee0, 4 the schedule 0x4947a0;
 *   - the history screen, comp_screens_open_history_screen 0x498780 (record, 0), built by 0x498a30.
 * The screen of a record is only opened when [0xadadfc][record id] is the object, as the news click tests
 * (0x764470..0x7644dc). The objects of record_utils (ReserveComp, BIntComp, Under21IntComp and the others) are left
 * out: they hold the records of reserve and international squads, have no stage, and Comp::get_stage 0x48d200
 * stops at "comp.cpp 878" (0x48d289) for them. The game never opens their screen. A pass starts at the first human
 * turn and at the first turn of each September, and takes one screen a turn, so a season's pass is spread over its
 * first months. The log names each screen
 * ("recomp: screen sweep: ... view n"), writes "recomp: screen sweep: built" at its first build and counts the
 * builds, so a run can tell that each screen was drawn. A box of the game while a screen is up is logged after
 * that screen's line (waits.c). */
