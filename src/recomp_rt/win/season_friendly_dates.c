/* The dates of international friendlies in a season game (row A18 of the 0.6.0 release test, O375, O390).
 *
 * Friendly::build_international_date_table 0x5ca4f0 (called once, from Friendly::Friendly 0x5c1f80 at 0x5c2180,
 * also when a save loads) writes 110 rows of 0x14 bytes at [this + 0x34ec], count [this + 0x34f0]: +0 a weekday
 * code, +1 the day, +2 the month (0 to 11), +3 the Date (8 bytes: s16 day of the year, s16 year, a word), +0xb a
 * year offset 0 to 3, +0xc the continent (the value of a key continent), +0x10 a key id. Its dates are the FIFA
 * windows of 2001. Then 0x5cc510 (called at 0x5cb98a) sets each Date with Date::set 0x54a130 for the World Cup year
 * of the cycle plus the offset (0x5cc56b..0x5cc5ac) and sorts the rows by date (qsort 0x945333 with 0x5cc610). The
 * arranger arrange_international_friendlies 0x5cbdf0 finds the rows of a date by bsearch and pairs nations of the
 * row's continent (docs/research/2026-10-18-national-team-comps.md, section 7).
 *
 * The cause. Those 2001 days often fall on the match days of the UEFA club competitions in a season game: the
 * qualifying rounds in July and August, the groups from September, the knockout rounds on the real dates of
 * season_uefa_dates.c (O378). NationalTeams::can_schedule_club_fixture 0x776fc0 then refuses a club's tie when more
 * than two of its players are on international duty within a day: FIXTURE_MANAGER::find_fixture_clashes 0x5ad780
 * gives clash 21 (0x5adb6b), and add_fixture 0x5aa680 moves the tie a week (0x5ab510 at 0x5aa96e). In a 2006 game
 * (gate (b) run on eee3e71a, 2009/10) the Champions League third qualifying round tie Aalborg v Borussia Dortmund
 * moved from 19 to 26 August (the August row), so its losers reached the Europa League after the play-off draw was
 * due (row A18, "drawn late"); in 2016/17 the second qualifying round tie Keflavik v Espanyol moved from 27 July (a
 * July row) and each round after it followed; in 2015/16 the Europa League tie Gent v Juventus on 26 April got clash
 * 21 too (an April row). The real FIFA calendar keeps its match days off the UEFA days.
 *
 * The fix, in a running season of a season game: each row takes the real FIFA match day of its month and year that
 * lies nearest to its own day (season_fifa_days, from the results of each day counted in two lists,
 * season_fifa_days_table.c). A month with no FIFA match day that year (July in every year, August from 2014, January and most Decembers) gives the row
 * none: its continent becomes -2, which no continent has, so the arranger pairs no one on it. (-1 would be wrong:
 * the arranger reads a continent of -1 as every continent, 0x5cc060..0x5cc070.) After the last year of
 * the list, the days of its last year move on by 364 days a year (plus 7 when that drifts over 3 days), as the UEFA
 * dates do (O381). The rows are sorted again. The base game keeps the original's table (Q152).
 *
 * The qualifying matches (O390, option Q). The qualifying groups of the World Cup and the European Championship are
 * leagues: their fixtures come from League::create_fixtures 0x6835c0 (add_fixture calls at 0x683a55 and 0x683dee)
 * and, for the South American section, WcSouthAmericanLeague::add_fixed_fixture (0x9225c1). Their days follow the
 * original's templates moved to each cycle, so they also fall on UEFA days: in a 2006 game the CONCACAF and
 * CONMEBOL matches of 5 August 2009 put Internazionale's internationals on duty for its Europa League tie of
 * 6 August (clash 21); real: CONCACAF 12 August, CONMEBOL 5 and 9 September. The Under 21 match of the same pair
 * comes the day before the senior match (ReserveComp::add_b_or_under21_fixture, the add_fixture call at 0x7e6a48),
 * so it is not moved here. In a running season of a season game, a fixture of two national sides from those calls,
 * in a competition that is not a finals tournament (national_teams_is_finals_comp 0x76d940), moves to the nearest
 * real FIFA match day of the same year, 2 or more days after today, on which no side of either nation (senior, B,
 * Under 21) has a national match yet and no continental club match is played (fix_man_get_fixture_list_for_date
 * 0x5ae6a0, all fixture types). A side's two matches of a
 * window so take two days. The search covers the whole year: a July matchday made after the June window has its
 * nearest free day in September (CONMEBOL on 6 July 2016 met a Champions League tie, CONCACAF on 12 July 2028 a
 * Europa League tie 71 days before the window). With no such day the fixture keeps its date (logged). Two-legged
 * qualifying ties (Cup::create_tie_fixtures) keep theirs, so a second leg never comes before its first. */
