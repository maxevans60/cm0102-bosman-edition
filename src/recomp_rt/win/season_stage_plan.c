/* The plan of a qualifying stage's match days (items 203 and 204 of 0.6.2). Pure code (season_stage_plan.h).
 *
 * The cause. Each qualifier moved on its own, as add_fixture stored it, to the nearest free FIFA day of its year
 * (season_friendly_dates.c fifa_target_by), with an end bound but no start bound and no matchday order. In a 2021
 * start (run set a2021s1, replay of 2031 to 2033) the AFC third round of the 2034 cycle has 10 weekly matchdays on
 * days 230 to 293 of 2033, and the FIFA days in reach were 159 to 164 and 271 to 281. Matchdays 1 to 4 took 271, 274,
 * 278 and 281; matchdays 5 and 6 went back to June (164 and 161), before matchday 1 and in reverse order (item 203);
 * matchdays 7 and 8 found no free FIFA day, kept 272 and 279, 1 or 2 days from matchdays 3 and 4 of the same sides,
 * and add_fixture's clash move (0x5aaa25) moved them 3 to 5 days (item 204).
 *
 * Real life: the rounds of a qualifying stage play in order, on the FIFA windows; the AFC third round of the 2026
 * cycle played its 10 matchdays in the windows of September, October and November 2024 and March and June 2025, two
 * a window (en.wikipedia.org, "2026 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC third round").
 *
 * The rule. The stage's days are planned once, from its round table, before its fixtures are made: rounds keep their
 * order, at least SEASON_STAGE_GAP days apart; each takes a FIFA day in reach, else its own day, else another day
 * between its neighbours; the plan with the most rounds on FIFA days and then the least total move wins. A small
 * dynamic programme over the rounds and the candidate days finds it: best[r][z] is the best score of rounds 0 to r
 * with round r on day z, and round r + 1 on day z' takes the best of round r on any day up to z' - GAP (a running
 * maximum over z). */
