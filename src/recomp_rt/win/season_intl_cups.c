/* The African Cup of Nations and the Asian Cup of 24 teams (0.6.0 slice 27): from 2019 both finals have 6
 * groups of 4. The top two of each group and the four best third-placed teams go to a round of 16, then
 * quarter-finals, semi-finals and the final. The African Cup of Nations of 2019 has a third-place match, the
 * Asian Cup of 2019 has none ("there was no third place play-off", source below). The edition table
 * (season_intl_table.c) gives the team count of each edition. The base game (season_intl_on() 0) and every
 * edition of 16 (ACN) or 12 (Asian Cup) teams take the original path: each site and wrap here gives the
 * original's value or calls the original then. The Asian Cup of 16 teams (2004 to 2015, 0.6.2 open item 44) has
 * 4 groups of 4 and quarter-finals of the top two (asian16 below). The 2004 edition of a 2001 game gets its
 * shape of 16 at its draw (the entrants wrap of 0x40fdf0, 0.6.2 item 180).
 *
 * The classes of the original (sweep-international section 2):
 * - african_nations: ctor 0x401000, vtable 0x967270. The League object is group A, stage[0..2] (+0xc, count
 *   +0x2c = 4 at 0x4010c5) are groups B to D, stage[3] the Cup_Stage of 8 (0x402090). The entrants and the draw
 *   (0x4022c0) write 16 team pointers in groups of 4 to +0xee (+0xf2 the count, 0x4022d3).
 * - asia_nations: ctor 0x40e860, vtable 0x967614. Group A, stage[0..1] groups B and C, stage[2] the Cup_Stage of
 *   8 (count 3 at 0x40e923), made by 0x40fa90 with the two best thirds. Entrants and draw 0x40fdf0 (12 at
 *   0x40fe02).
 * With 24 teams stage[0..4] are groups B to F and stage[5] the Cup_Stage of 16 in both classes.
 *
 * Sites in tools/recomp/seasons.py ("ACN and Asian Cup of 24 teams").
 *
 * Sources of the brackets and the third-place table (read 2026-10-18):
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Africa_Cup_of_Nations_knockout_stage and
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_AFC_Asian_Cup_knockout_stage. Both give the same 15-row table as
 * UEFA Euro 2016 (season_intl_euro.c). The CAF and AFC regulations were not read: second source needed. */
