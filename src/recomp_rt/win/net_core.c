/* The game's sockets (net_core.h). Items 2 to 9, 11 and 13 of section 9 of
 * docs/research/2026-10-27-network-code-reading.md.
 *
 * Handles. The game keeps a socket as a dword and compares it with -1. Each new socket gets the next
 * number, so a handle that the game closes twice (0x8aec17, then 0x8aec24) is unknown the second time
 * and that close fails quietly with WSAENOTSOCK.
 *
 * Blocking. Every host socket is non-blocking. The game sets each socket that it reads non-blocking
 * (FIONBIO), and blocks only in connect (0x8ae74e, 0x8af4e6). connect waits at most NC_CONNECT_MS, so a
 * wrong address does not freeze the game.
 *
 * Whole sends. Network::send_packet 0x77ac30 sends a 4-byte length in four 1-byte sends, then the body,
 * and checks only for -2 from TcpIp::send_to_connection 0x8ae8d0, which can return a short count
 * (0x8ae966). So nc_send takes the whole buffer every time. What the system cannot take now waits in a
 * queue that each later call moves on. The queue also holds the length bytes until the body follows,
 * so a packet leaves in one send with TCP_NODELAY: no wait on the peer's delayed acknowledgement between
 * the length and the body. Any call other than a send to that socket sends what is held.
 *
 * UDP. The game binds each UDP socket to an adapter address on port 6667 (0x8aec05) and broadcasts to
 * the adapter's subnet broadcast. Windows delivers a subnet broadcast to such a socket. macOS does not
 * (tested on this Mac, 2026-10-27), and Linux delivers a broadcast only to sockets on any address. And when two games on one computer share port 6667, the
 * system gives a datagram sent to one address and port to only one of them. So a UDP socket of the game
 * is two host sockets: one on any address, port 6667, shared (SO_REUSEADDR and SO_REUSEPORT), that takes
 * the broadcasts, and one on the adapter address with a port of the system's choice, that sends. The
 * host's ACK goes back to the sender's address and port (0x8aed5a), so it reaches the right game. The
 * same on Windows, so every system behaves alike. The game opens one UDP socket for each adapter
 * (0x8aea80), and each shared socket gets every broadcast. So a shared socket keeps only the datagrams
 * whose sender is in its adapter's subnet, as a socket bound to the adapter address on Windows does.
 * Else a host would answer one request once for each adapter, and a joiner that gets one BYE for each
 * adapter would add a row for each copy after the first (0x77b448).
 *
 * Traffic. Each TCP connection counts bytes, sends and packets in both directions. A packet is a
 * 4-byte length and its body (0x77ac30, 0x77b45e).
 *
 * Join check (0.7.0 slice 4, net_core.h). The joiner's side runs inside connect, which the game calls on a
 * blocking socket and waits for (connect_to_host 0x8ae640, connect at 0x8ae74e). The host's side runs inside
 * accept: TcpIp::accept_connection 0x8ae840 polls accept on each listen socket while a player slot is free
 * (0x77af5a). A new connection waits in a list until its block is read, and accept says "would block" until
 * then. So the game sees only joiners that passed, as if the others never came.
 *
 * Control packets (0.7.0 slice 7, net_core.h). On a connection that passed the join check, both runtimes may put
 * a packet of their own between two packets of the game: the 4-byte length, the opcode NC_CONTROL_OP, which the
 * game never sends (Display::process_command_packet 0x564080 switches on 0..26 through the table at 0x567a1c), and
 * a line "BOSMAN PING <n>", "BOSMAN PONG <n>" or "BOSMAN KICK". A send puts one only where the game's own stream is
 * between two packets, and nc_recv takes each one out where the game's reads are between two packets, before
 * the game reads the next length byte. So the game never sees them, and they pass the relay as any bytes. */
