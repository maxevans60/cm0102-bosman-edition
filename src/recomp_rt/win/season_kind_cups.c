/* Rule kind "cups" of the season change (season_change.h): the round formats of the domestic cups by season
 * (0.6.0 slice 21, docs/research/2026-10-17-cup-round-record.md).
 *
 * The cup classes of the original make their round table in create_round_table (a virtual of each class, called
 * with stage 0xff by set_up_rounds, vtable +0x8c): at a new game, in start_new_season, and again at times that
 * are not a season start (the FA Cup table was made anew by 1 June of its first season; a log of
 * every start_new_season showed none in between). So the kind does not write the table after a season
 * start. It wraps create_round_table of each cup class that has a row in the cups table and changes the table
 * that the function returns (0x68 bytes a round, five format fields, season_cups.h) before the caller stores it.
 * Whatever makes the table, it holds the format of the season:
 * - the season of a cup is its season year (cup+0x40, set before the table is made) with changing rules on,
 *   and the start year of the game with changing rules off (the rules stay, Q232);
 * - a season without a row, and a game that starts in 2001/02 with changing rules off, keep the original's
 *   rounds (the table has no row before 2002).
 * A saved game keeps its table in its cup file (Cup::save_cup_to_disk 0x5210f0 writes the rounds, Cup::
 * load_from_disk 0x51fc00 reads them without a call of create_round_table), so a load changes nothing.
 * The news sentence of a row comes in the after hook of the season change, once for the cup that starts that
 * season. */
