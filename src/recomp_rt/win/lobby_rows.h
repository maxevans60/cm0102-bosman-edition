/* The rows of the game list (0.7.0 slice 4, #45): the LAN games and the lobby's games, one row for each host.
 *
 * The game list (setup_build_select_network_game_screen 0x81f8d0) fills from the UDP datagrams that
 * Network::receive_packet 0x77af20 reads (research note docs/research/2026-10-27-network-code-reading.md,
 * section 2): an ACK adds a row with the sender's address (0x77b10d) and the game name of bytes 69..118
 * (0x77b12b), and a BYE removes the row of its sender (0x77b335). This module sits under those reads. It
 * changes no packet layout: it drops some datagrams and adds others in the 119-byte layout of the original.
 *
 * One row for each host. A host sends one ACK from each of its adapters that the joiner's request reaches
 * (section 11, finding 2). The ACK holds the host's computer name (bytes 19..68, from gethostname 0x77aa77) and
 * the game name, which together name the host's game. The first ACK of a game whose sender is on the subnet of
 * this computer's default route goes to the game at once. Any other first ACK waits HOLD_MS for a better one.
 * Later ACKs of the same game from another address are dropped, and so are BYEs from an address that has no
 * row (the original adds a row for a BYE that matches none, 0x77b448).
 *
 * Lobby rows. Each lobby game that is not on the LAN is an ACK from an address in 0.66.0.0/16 (LR_NET), which
 * no real host has (0.0.0.0/8 is "this network"). The row text is the game name with the season, the day and
 * the managers online. A connect to any address in 0.66.0.0/16 goes to lr_row_of (net_lobby.c) and never to
 * the system.
 * A lobby game is the same as a LAN game when its hostName is lr_host_key of the ACK's computer name and the
 * names match. Lobby rows go to the game LOBBY_WAIT_MS after the request at the earliest, so that the LAN
 * answers come first. When the lobby answers "full today", one row says so. When it gives no answer, one row says
 * that (0.7.0 slice 7). */
