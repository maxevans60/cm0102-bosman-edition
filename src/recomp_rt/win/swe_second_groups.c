/* The Swedish Second Division groups take the clubs that the data holds in them (open item 224).
 *
 * SweSecond (swe_second.cpp, the extra division of Sweden) is made at a new game by its constructor 0x8916f0
 * (called at 0x837ca5). Before it, SwePrm's constructor 0x88fb10 moves each club of the six group records into the
 * Swedish Second Division record (club +0x57 = [0x9cf7c8]) and keeps the group in club +0x60. The constructor then
 * makes the North group with 0x8921b0, which sets the class count +0x3e to 12 (0x8921c2) and needs 12 North clubs
 * (else swe_second.cpp 80), and the other five groups with SweSecond::create_group_stage 0x892670 (thiscall, the
 * group 0 to 4; ret 4). That function takes the group record from [0x9cf5fc], [0x9cf604], [0x9cf600], [0x9cf608] or
 * [0x9cf5f4] (0x8926c8..0x892704), reads the count from the class +0x3e (0x892693), collects the clubs of the
 * division whose +0x60 record has that id (0x89277a..0x89281a), stops at swe_second.cpp 643 (0x283) for a club
 * over the count and at swe_second.cpp 656 (0x290, 0x89283f..0x89286d) for fewer, and makes the stage with the
 * count (0x8928f2, the second argument of 0x68b100).
 *
 * Real life: the 2001 Division 2 had six groups, five of 12 clubs and Östra Svealand of 11 (20 matches a club;
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Division_2_(Swedish_football)). The 3.9.60 data holds those 11 in East
 * Svealand, so a new game on the default 2001/02 data (3.9.60 since 0.6.1) with the Swedish extra division
 * stopped at swe_second.cpp 656. The 3.9.68 data holds 12 in each group.
 *
 * So a group with fewer clubs than the class count takes the clubs that the data holds in it: for the call, the
 * class count is the group's club count, and after it the class count is 12 again (the North group's, which the
 * class keeps for its own table). The later readers take each stage's own count (+0x3e of the stage: 0x892a10,
 * 0x892bb0, 0x893470), and a smaller stage fits their tables: 0x893470 sorts each stage in a block of 12 pointers
 * (0x30 bytes, 0x8934b4), and 0x891a60 gives each group 22 dates (0x891af8), the 22 rounds of 11 or 12 clubs.
 * A group with more clubs than the count does not fit them (13 clubs need 13 pointers and 26 rounds), so it keeps
 * the original's stop at line 643. The wrap also runs at the season rebuild (0x892410 calls 0x892670 at 0x8925a4),
 * with the same test. With 12 clubs in the group nothing changes. One log line each time a group takes another
 * count.
 *
 * The 3.9.65 data holds 13 clubs in East Svealand, so a new game with the Swedish extra division stopped at
 * swe_second.cpp 643 (the box from 0x8927ff). A 2001/02 game plays the Swedish season of 2002 first (the start
 * screen names "Sweden 2002"), and the 3.9.65 groups hold the 2002 clubs. The 13th club is Katrineholms SK
 * (club +0x5b, the previous division, is -2 in the data). The real 2002 Division 2 Östra
 * Svealand had 12 clubs without it (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Division_2_(Swedish_football)), and
 * Katrineholms SK FK played the 2002 Division 3 Östra Svealand
 * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Division_3_(Swedish_football)). SwePrm's constructor 0x88fb10 puts each
 * club of the six group records in the Second Division record and keeps the group in club +0x60 (0x88fbb0..0x88fc1f),
 * and puts every other Swedish club in the Lower Division record [0x9cf6ac]. So before that loop, with the
 * extra division flag of Sweden (nation +0x11c bit 0x04, read at 0x837add) and more clubs in a group than the
 * class count, a club that REAL_DIVISION names in that group takes the division of real life: its club +0x57
 * becomes the record of that division, and the loop then puts it in the Lower Division with the other Third
 * Division clubs. One log line each time. Without the extra division the Second Division groups are not played,
 * and the game stays as before. */
