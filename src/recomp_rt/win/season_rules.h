/* The rules table and the rules report (0.6.0 slice 12; spec docs/specs/2026-10-16-seasons-0.6.0-spec.md,
 * "Testing" and slice 12).
 *
 * The rules table: one row per league or competition per season, 2001/02 to 2027/28. The research parts are
 * docs/research/rules-0.6.0/<part>.tsv. tools/seasons/make_rules.py turns them into one file, Seasons/rules.tsv
 * of the download, with the structured columns as values (its docstring gives the format). The game reads
 * the file once at the start (season_rules_init). This slice changes no rule: later slices (15 to 29) read
 * the rows through this API. A missing or damaged file leaves the table empty and the game plays as before.
 *
 * The rules report (Q265, season_report.c): a test flag that writes the competitions that the game holds at
 * the start of each season. tests/seasons/rules_report_check.py compares the report with the table. */
