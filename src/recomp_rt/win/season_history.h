/* Competition history between 2001 and the start season (0.6.0 slice 11c, Q347).
 *
 * The season databases before 2010/11 hold no competition history between 2001 and the season before the
 * start. (Four databases of 2010/11 and 2011/12 hold no US Open Cup row at all, though Con_Champ::pick_clubs
 * 0x4c11a0 reads its newest winner for CONCACAF place 1: plan.tsv gives them the researched US Open Cup rows only,
 * tools/seasons/history_fill.py, GAP_COMPETITIONS.) At the database load of a new game in the season of such a database, after the year shift of slice
 * 11b, the game adds the researched rows (docs/research/history-0.6.0/, the research of each fact with its
 * sources) to the history table in memory. The database files stay unchanged. A loaded save needs nothing: it
 * holds the rows.
 *
 * For each competition that holds history rows in the database and each label year from 2002 to the start
 * year that the research covers, the rows of the database for that year are cleared (their competition becomes
 * 0, the free row of the original, 0x4afce0), and the researched rows are written. The research wins over the
 * rows of the database: most of those rows hold the result of another season (slice doc
 * docs/research/2026-10-17-competition-history-fill.md).
 *
 * It runs from season_dates.c, right after the shift, and it is undone with the shift when the shift is made
 * again for another year. It does nothing in the base game (start 2001), for a start year that is not the
 * season of the database, for a Custom database, and with RECOMP_SEASON_CODE=off.
 *
 * Duplicate rows. Many season databases hold the same history row twice: the same competition, label year and
 * four places (September 2010 ODB: 175 rows, among them the English Premier Division 2001 Chelsea / Manchester
 * United, which the shift of slice 11b makes 2010; tests/seasons/history_duplicates_check.py lists every
 * database). The winners tab 0x4991f0 then shows the year twice. Before the fill, every season database load
 * with a shift (season_dates.c) clears the second and later copy of each such row in the same way, and the undo
 * gives them back. The base game and its 3.9.68 data (2 such rows) are not touched.
 *
 * Rows after the start (0.6.2 slice 7, open items 3 and 17). The data holds results of editions that the game
 * then plays itself: the 3.9.68 data holds 128 club rows and 3 nation rows of the label year 2002 (the 2001/02
 * season, Arsenal) and the results of August to December 2001 (Charity Shield 2001 Liverpool / Manchester
 * United), in a game that starts in July 2001; the season databases hold the calendar-year leagues and the
 * super cups of their start year. The game then writes the same edition again, so the history shows the year
 * twice, and it reads the newest row (Con_Champ::pick_clubs 0x4c11a0 through 0x4afd80): its 2001 Charity Shield
 * is Liverpool against Arsenal, the 2002 champion. So at the creation of a new game every row with a label after
 * the start year S goes (season_history_drop_after_start, with the undo record), and when the game writes a row
 * (0x4afce0), every other row of that competition with a later label goes, and in the calendar year S the row of
 * the data with the same label (not when the data holds two or more of them: the halves of a split season). A row
 * of the year S of a competition that ends before July (the English Premier Division 2001 in a 2001/02 game)
 * stays: the game writes no row of that label. */
