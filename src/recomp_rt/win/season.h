/* The season of a game (0.6.0 slice 11): its start year and its changing rules switch.
 *
 * The original starts every game in the 2001/02 season. Here the start year is a run-time value
 * (rt_season_year in rt.h). The year sites of tools/recomp/seasons.py read it in place of the constant
 * 2001, so a game can start in July of another year. With start year 2001 every site gives the
 * original's result.
 *
 * The values of the game that runs:
 * - a new game takes the values of the last season_set_new_game call (start year 2001 and the option
 *   changing_rules before any call, or the year of the test variable RECOMP_START_SEASON);
 * - a loaded game takes the values of the season part of its save (bosman_season.dat). A save without the
 *   part, as every save of 0.5.0 and earlier and every base game save, is 2001 with changing rules off.
 *   A damaged part stops the load with a message box. A part of a later version loads with the fields
 *   that this version knows;
 * - at the end of a game (free_game_data 0x82ff40) the values go back to those of a new game.
 * The save writes the part only when the start year is not 2001 or changing rules is on. When it cannot,
 * the save reports a failure with a message box. The format and the
 * proof that the original skips the part are in docs/research/2026-10-17-season-save-part.md. */
